<h2><a name="preface" id="preface"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">So</span> much interest has lately been awakened in, and centred
round, Folklore, that it needs no apology to lay before the
British reader additional information upon the subject.
Interesting enough in itself, it has been rendered doubly
interesting by the rise and progress of the new science of
Comparative Mythology, which has already yielded considerable
results, and promises to yield results of still greater
magnitude, when all the data requisite for a full and complete
induction have been brought under the ken of the
inquirer. The stories of most European races have been
laid under contribution, but those of the Slavonians have,
as yet, been only partially examined. Circumstances have
enabled me to make a considerable addition to what is as
yet known of Slavonic Folklore, although I cannot make
any pretence to having exhausted the mine, or, rather, the
many mines, which the various Slavonic races and tribes
possess, and which still, more or less, await the advent of
competent explorers.</p>

<p>In offering to the public a selection of sixty folklore
stories translated from exclusively Slavonic sources, it is but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>iv]</a></span>
fitting to give some account of the work from which I have
derived them. In 1865, the late K.&nbsp;J. Erben, the celebrated
Archivarius of the old town of Prague, published a &lsquo;Citanka,&rsquo;
or reading-book, intended to enable Bohemians to commence
the study of all the numerous Slavonic dialects,
containing &lsquo;one hundred simple national tales and stories,
in their original dialects.&rsquo; To this he appended a vocabulary,
with explanations of words and forms strange to, or
divergent from, the Bohemian, briefly given in the Bohemian
language. This vocabulary is divided into two parts, one
illustrating the tales of those Slavonians who make use of
the Cyrillic characters, and belong to the Orthodox Greek
Church; and the other, those of the Catholic and Protestant
Slavonians, who employ alphabets founded on the Latin
characters of the West of Europe. Pan Erben paid special
attention to the preservation of the simple national forms
of speech, as taken down from the lips of the people;
and, besides laying printed collections under contribution,
obtained several previously unpublished stories.</p>

<p>Beginning with his native tongue, the Bohemian language,
he passes on to the closely-allied Moravian and Hungarian-Slovenish
(Slovak) dialects, and then takes the Upper and
Lower Lusatian, the former of which is related to the old
Bohemian, while the latter inclines rather to the Polish
language. He next goes on to the Kashubian, a rapidly-perishing
sub-dialect of Polish, and then to the Polish
tongue itself.</p>

<p>Next comes the White Russian, forming a transition from
Polish to Great Russian, whereas the Little Russian in Galicia,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>v]</a></span>
the Ukraine, and South Russia, is more nearly allied to the
Bohemian than to the White Russian. The ancient Russian
language, which was also much allied to the Old Bohemian,
is the basis of the present written Russian, and presents a
transition to the Bulgarian, which, in the north-west, melts
into the Serbian, which again, in its Croatian branch, near
Varazdin, approaches most nearly to the Bohemian. The
Illyrian-Slovenish of Carinthia, though, in locality, least
distant from Bohemia, exhibits forms most removed from
the Bohemian language, just as the Upper Lusatian is less
allied to the Bohemian than is the locally-distant Kashubian.</p>

<p>I took up the book, originally, for the purpose for which
it was compiled, viz., that of obtaining an acquaintance
with the main features of all the Slavonic dialects, but found
myself tempted, by the extreme beauty of some of the stories,
to translate the major portion of them. That I do not
present a still larger selection to the reader is due to the fact
that so many of the Great Russian <i>skazkas</i> have been so
admirably translated, edited, and illustrated by my friend&mdash;alas!
that I must now term him my late friend&mdash;Mr. W.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;S.
Ralston, that I have scarcely considered them as
coming within the sphere of the present work.</p>

<p>For an essay on the singular mythical being, <i>Kurent</i>,
occurring only in the Serbian tales from Carniola, and as
yet unnoticed in any work on Slavonic mythology, I am
indebted to Professor Gregor Krek, of Gr&auml;tz, in Styria.
This will be found prefixed to the stories which it illustrates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>vi]</a></span>
I have also prefixed a short introduction, containing
various matters of interest, to each set of tales, as they
follow each other, according to their different languages,
dialects, or sub-dialects.</p>

<p>The table of contents immediately following will give a
general view of the stories and their respective sources,
arranged under the three heads of: (<i>a</i>) The Western
Slavonians, (<i>b</i>) the Eastern Slavonians, and (<i>c</i>) the Southern
Slavonians.</p>

<h3><a name="part01a" id="part01a"></a><i>BOHEMIAN STORIES.</i></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HESE stories are translated from the language of
the Slavonic inhabitants of nearly three-fourths of
Bohemia, the &lsquo;Czechs,&rsquo; as the Poles write the word, or
&lsquo;Chekhs,&rsquo; if we adopt the nearest orthographical approximation
to it that the English alphabet allows us to make. This
nation had an early literary development, commencing before
the foundation of the University of Prague (<i>Praha</i>) by the
Emperor Charles IV. in 1348. For a long time after that
epoch the Bohemians could justly claim the title of the best
educated nation in Europe. They produced a prose writer&mdash;Thomas
of Stitny, whose first original work was published
in 1377&mdash;whose equal is not to be found in English literature
till the age of Queen Elizabeth. In the Thirty Years&rsquo;
War (1620) the people and literature of Bohemia were
crushed for more than two centuries, the population being
reduced during that terrible war from over four millions to
eight hundred thousand.</p>

<p>The Bohemian language itself is a very remarkable one.
It possesses both accent and quantity independent of each
other, like Latin and Greek. Thus it is difficult for a
foreigner to read aloud or to speak, for, if he attends
carefully to the accent, he is liable to neglect quantity, and
if he attends to quantity, he is likely to slur over the proper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
accentuation of words. It, as well as Polish, employs a
sibillated <i>r</i>, which in many words is difficult to pronounce.
It also writes semi-vowels, especially <i>r</i>, without a vowel; so
that many syllables appear as if there were no vowel in
them. But this it is sufficient to notice once for all, as it
causes no real difficulty in pronunciation.</p>

<p>The fairy-tales relating to the kindly or malevolent superhuman
inhabitants of the woods are peculiar and striking.
In <a href="#chap05">No. 5</a> these imaginary beings are represented under the
latter, and in <a href="#chap06">No. 6</a> under the former aspect.</p>

<p><em>Two</em> waters, one of death and the other of life, are found
in the Bohemian stories, just as in the Russian ones&mdash;a
point wherein the Slavonic tales regularly differ from those
of Western Europe, which only acknowledge the water of
life. As Mr. Ralston remarks (&lsquo;Songs of the Russian
People,&rsquo; p. 97): &lsquo;When the &ldquo;dead water&rdquo; is applied to
the wounds of a corpse, it heals them, but before the dead
body can be brought to life, it is necessary to sprinkle it
with the &ldquo;living water.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap01" id="chap01"></a>I.&mdash;LONG, BROAD, AND SHARPSIGHT.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a king, who was already old, and had but one
son. Once upon a time he called this son to him, and said
to him, &lsquo;My dear son! you know that old fruit falls to
make room for other fruit. My head is already ripening,
and maybe the sun will soon no longer shine upon it; but
before you bury me, I should like to see your wife, my
future daughter. My son, marry!&rsquo; The prince said, &lsquo;I
would gladly, father, do as you wish; but I have no bride,
and don&rsquo;t know any.&rsquo; The old king put his hand into his
pocket, took out a golden key and showed it to his son,
with the words, &lsquo;Go up into the tower, to the top story,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
look round there, and then tell me which you fancy.&rsquo; The
prince went without delay. Nobody within the memory of
man had been up there, or had ever heard what was up
there.</p>

<p>When he got up to the last story, he saw in the ceiling a
little iron door like a trap-door. It was closed. He opened
it with the golden key, lifted it, and went up above it.
There there was a large circular room. The ceiling was blue
like the sky on a clear night, and silver stars glittered on it;
the floor was a carpet of green silk, and around in the wall
were twelve high windows in golden frames, and in each
window on crystal glass was a damsel painted with the
colours of the rainbow, with a royal crown on her head, in
each window a different one in a different dress, each handsomer
than the other, and it was a wonder that the prince
did not let his eyes dwell upon them. When he had gazed
at them with astonishment, the damsels began to move as
if they were alive, looked down upon him, smiled, and did
everything but speak.</p>

<p>Now the prince observed that one of the twelve windows
was covered with a white curtain; he drew the curtain to
see what was behind it. There there was a damsel in a white
dress, girt with a silver girdle, with a crown of pearls on her
head; she was the most beautiful of all, but was sad and
pale, as if she had risen from the grave. The prince stood
long before the picture, as if he had made a discovery, and
as he thus gazed, his heart pained him, and he cried, &lsquo;This
one will I have, and no other.&rsquo; As he said the words the
damsel bowed her head, blushed like a rose, and that instant
all the pictures disappeared.</p>

<p>When he went down and related to his father what he
had seen and which damsel he had selected, the old king
became sad, bethought himself, and said, &lsquo;You have done
ill, my son, in uncovering what was curtained over, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
have placed yourself in great danger on account of those
words. That damsel is in the power of a wicked wizard,
and kept captive in an iron castle; of all who have attempted
to set her free, not one has hitherto returned. But what&rsquo;s
done cannot be undone; the plighted word is a law. Go!
try your luck, and return home safe and sound!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The prince took leave of his father, mounted his horse,
and rode away in search of his bride. It came to pass that
he rode through a vast forest, and through the forest he
rode on and on till he lost the road. And as he was
wandering with his horse in thickets and amongst rocks
and morasses, not knowing which way to turn, he heard
somebody shout behind him, &lsquo;Hi! stop!&rsquo; The prince
looked round, and saw a tall man hastening after him.
&lsquo;Stop and take me with you, and take me into your service,
and you won&rsquo;t regret it!&rsquo; &lsquo;Who are you,&rsquo; said the prince,
&lsquo;and what can you do?&rsquo; &lsquo;My name is Long, and I can
extend myself. Do you see a bird&rsquo;s nest in that pine
yonder? I will bring you the nest down without having to
climb up.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Long then began to extend himself; his body grew rapidly
till it was as tall as the pine; he then reached the nest, and
in a moment contracted himself again and gave it to the
prince. &lsquo;You know your business well, but what&rsquo;s the use
of birds&rsquo; nests to me, if you can&rsquo;t conduct me out of this
forest?&rsquo; &lsquo;Ahem! that&rsquo;s an easy matter,&rsquo; said Long, and
began to extend himself till he was thrice as high as the
highest fir in the forest, looked round, and said: &lsquo;Here on
this side we have the nearest way out of the forest.&rsquo; He
then contracted himself, took the horse by the bridle, and
before the prince had any idea of it, they were beyond the
forest. Before them was a long and wide plain, and beyond
the plain tall gray rocks, like the walls of a large town, and
mountains overgrown with forest trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
&lsquo;Yonder, sir, goes my comrade!&rsquo; said Long, and pointed
suddenly to the plain; &lsquo;you should take him also into your
service; I believe he would serve you well.&rsquo; &lsquo;Shout to
him, and call him hither, that I may see what he is good
for.&rsquo; &lsquo;It is a little too far, sir,&rsquo; said Long; &lsquo;he would hardly
hear me, and it would take a long time before he came,
because he has a great deal to carry. I&rsquo;ll jump after him
instead.&rsquo; Then Long again extended himself to such a
height that his head plunged into the clouds, made two or
three steps, took his comrade by the arm, and placed him
before the prince. He was a short, thick-set fellow, with a
paunch like a sixty-four gallon cask. &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo;
demanded the prince, &lsquo;and what can you do?&rsquo; &lsquo;My name,
sir, is Broad; I can widen myself.&rsquo; &lsquo;Give me a specimen.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Ride quick, sir, quick, back into the forest!&rsquo; cried Broad,
as he began to blow himself out.</p>

<p>The prince didn&rsquo;t understand why he was to ride away;
but seeing that Long made all haste to get into the forest,
he spurred his horse, and rode full gallop after him. It was
high time that he did ride away, or else Broad would have
squashed him, horse and all, as his paunch rapidly grew in
all directions; it filled everything everywhere, just as if a
mountain had rolled up. Broad then ceased to blow himself
out, and took himself in again, raising such a wind that
the trees in the forest bowed and bent, and became what
he was at first. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve played me a nice trick,&rsquo; said the
prince, &lsquo;but I shan&rsquo;t find such a fellow every day; come
with me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>They proceeded further. When they approached the
rocks, they met a man who had his eyes bandaged with a
handkerchief. &lsquo;Sir, this is our third comrade,&rsquo; said Long,
&lsquo;you ought to take him also into your service. I&rsquo;m sure he
won&rsquo;t eat his victuals for naught.&rsquo; &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; the
prince asked him, &lsquo;and why are your eyes bandaged? You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
don&rsquo;t see your way!&rsquo; &lsquo;No, sir, quite the contrary! It is
just because I see too well that I am obliged to bandage
my eyes; I see with bandaged eyes just as well as others
with unbandaged eyes; and if I unbandage them I look
everything through and through, and when I gaze sharply
at anything, it catches fire and bursts into flame, and what
can&rsquo;t burn splits into pieces. For this reason my name is
Sharpsight.&rsquo; He then turned to a rock opposite, removed
the bandage, and fixed his flaming eyes upon it; the rock
began to crackle, pieces flew on every side, and in a very
short time nothing of it remained but a heap of sand, on
which something glittered like fire. Sharpsight went to fetch
it, and brought it to the prince. It was pure gold.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Heigho! you&rsquo;re a fellow that money can&rsquo;t purchase!&rsquo;
said the prince. &lsquo;He is a fool who wouldn&rsquo;t make use of
your services, and if you have such good sight, look and
tell me whether it is far to the iron castle, and what is now
going on there?&rsquo; &lsquo;If you rode by yourself, sir,&rsquo; answered
Sharpsight, &lsquo;maybe you wouldn&rsquo;t get there within a year;
but with us you&rsquo;ll arrive to-day&mdash;they&rsquo;re just getting supper
ready for us.&rsquo; &lsquo;And what is my bride doing?&rsquo;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&lsquo;An iron lattice is before her,</div>
<div class="i1">In a tower that&rsquo;s high</div>
<div class="i1">She doth sit and sigh,</div>
<div class="i0">A wizard watch and ward keeps o&rsquo;er her.&rsquo;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The prince cried, &lsquo;Whoever is well disposed, help me to
set her free!&rsquo; They all promised to help him. They
guided him among the gray rocks through the breach that
Sharpsight had made in them with his eyes, and further and
further on through rocks, through high mountains and deep
forests, and wherever there was any obstacle in the road,
forthwith it was removed by the three comrades. And
when the sun was declining towards the west, the mountains
began to become lower, the forests less dense, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
rocks concealed themselves amongst the heath; and when
it was almost on the point of setting, the prince saw not far
before him an iron castle; and when it was actually setting,
he rode by an iron bridge to the gate, and as soon as it had
set, up rose the iron bridge of itself, the gate closed with a
single movement, and the prince and his companions were
captives in the iron castle.</p>

<p>When they had looked round in the court, the prince put
his horse up in the stable, where everything was ready for it,
and then they went into the castle. In the court, in the
stable, in the castle hall, and in the rooms, they saw in the
twilight many richly-dressed people, gentlemen and servants,
but not one of them stirred&mdash;they were all turned to stone.
They went through several rooms, and came into the
supper-room. This was brilliantly lighted up, and in the
midst was a table, and on it plenty of good meats and
drinks, and covers were laid for four persons. They waited
and waited, thinking that someone would come; but when
nobody came for a long time, they sat down and ate and
drank what the palate fancied.</p>

<p>When they had done eating, they looked about to find
where to sleep. Thereupon the door flew open unexpectedly
all at once, and into the room came the wizard; a bent old
man in a long black garb, with a bald head, a gray beard
down to his knees, and three iron hoops instead of a girdle.
By the hand he led a beautiful, very beautiful damsel,
dressed in white; she had a silver girdle round her waist,
and a crown of pearls on her head, but was pale and sad, as
if she had risen from the grave. The prince recognised her
at once, sprang forward, and went to meet her; but before
he could utter a word the wizard addressed him: &lsquo;I know
for what you have come; you want to take the princess
away. Well, be it so! Take her, if you can keep her in
sight for three nights, so that she doesn&rsquo;t vanish from you.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
If she vanishes, you will be turned into stone as well as your
three servants; like all who have come before you.&rsquo; He
then motioned the princess to a seat and departed.</p>

<p>The prince could not take his eyes off the princess, so
beautiful was she. He began to talk to her, and asked her
all manner of questions, but she neither answered nor
smiled, nor looked at anyone any more than if she had
been of marble. He sat down by her, and determined
not to sleep all night long lest she should vanish from
him, and, to make surer, Long extended himself like a
strap, and wound himself round the whole room along the
wall; Broad posted himself in the doorway, swelled himself
up, and stopped it up so tight that not even a mouse could
have slipped through; while Sharpsight placed himself
against a pillar in the midst of the room on the look-out.
But after a time they all began to nod, fell asleep, and slept
the whole night, just as if the wizard had thrown them into
the water.</p>

<p>In the morning, when it began to dawn, the prince was
the first to wake, but&mdash;as if a knife had been thrust into his
heart&mdash;the princess was gone! He forthwith awoke his
servants, and asked what was to be done. &lsquo;Never mind,
sir,&rsquo; said Sharpsight, and looked sharply out through the
window, &lsquo;I see her already. A hundred miles hence is a
forest, in the midst of the forest an old oak, and on the top
of the oak an acorn, and she is that acorn.&rsquo; Long immediately
took him on his shoulders, extended himself, and went
ten miles at a step, while Sharpsight showed him the way.</p>

<p>No more time elapsed than would have been wanted to
move once round a cottage before they were back again,
and Long delivered the acorn to the prince. &lsquo;Sir, let it
fall on the ground.&rsquo; The prince let it fall, and that moment
the princess stood beside him. And when the sun began
to show itself beyond the mountains, the folding doors flew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
open with a crash, and the wizard entered the room and
smiled spitefully; but when he saw the princess he frowned,
growled, and bang! one of the iron hoops which he wore
splintered and sprang off him. He then took the damsel
by the hand and led her away.</p>

<p>The whole day after the prince had nothing to do but
walk up and down the castle, and round about the castle,
and look at the wonderful things that were there. It
was everywhere as if life had been lost in a single moment.
In one hall he saw a prince, who held in both hands a
brandished sword, as if he intended to cleave somebody in
twain; but the blow never fell: he had been turned into
stone. In one chamber was a knight turned into stone,
just as if he had been fleeing from some one in terror, and,
stumbling on the threshold, had taken a downward direction,
but not fallen. Under the chimney sat a servant, who
held in one hand a piece of roast meat, and with the other
lifted a mouthful towards his mouth, which never reached
it; when it was just in front of his mouth, he had also been
turned to stone. Many others he saw there turned to
stone, each in the position in which he was when the wizard
said, &lsquo;Be turned into stone.&rsquo; He likewise saw many fine
horses turned to stone, and in the castle and round the castle
all was desolate and dead; there were trees, but without
leaves; there were meadows, but without grass; there was
a river, but it did not flow; nowhere was there even a singing
bird, or a flower, the offspring of the ground, or a white
fish in the water.</p>

<p>Morning, noon, and evening the prince and his companions
found good and abundant entertainment in the
castle; the viands came of themselves, the wine poured
itself out. After supper the folding doors opened again,
and the wizard brought in the princess for the prince to
guard. And although they all determined to exert
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
themselves with all their might not to fall asleep, yet it was of no
use, fall asleep again they did. And when the prince awoke
at dawn and saw the princess had vanished, he jumped up
and pulled Sharpsight by the arm, &lsquo;Hey! get up, Sharpsight,
do you know where the princess is?&rsquo; He rubbed his eyes,
looked, and said, &lsquo;I see her. There&rsquo;s a mountain 200
miles off, and in the mountain a rock, and in the rock a
precious stone, and she&rsquo;s that precious stone. If Long
carries me thither, we shall obtain her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Long took him at once on his shoulders, extended himself,
and went twenty miles at a step. Sharpsight fixed his
flaming eyes on the mountain, the mountain crumbled, and
the rock in it split into a thousand pieces, and amongst
them glittered the precious stone. They took it up and
brought it to the prince, and when he let it fall on the
ground, the princess again stood there. When afterwards
the wizard came and saw her there, his eyes flashed with
spite, and bang! again an iron hoop cracked upon him and
flew off. He growled and led the princess out of the room.</p>

<p>That day all was again as it had been the day before.
After supper the wizard brought the princess in again, looked
the prince keenly in the face, and scornfully uttered the
words, &lsquo;It will be seen who&rsquo;s a match for whom; whether
you are victorious or I,&rsquo; and with that he departed. This
day they all exerted themselves still more to avoid going to
sleep. They wouldn&rsquo;t even sit down, they wanted to walk
about all night long, but all in vain; they were bewitched;
one fell asleep after the other as he walked, and the princess
vanished away from them.</p>

<p>In the morning the prince again awoke earliest, and when
he didn&rsquo;t see the princess, woke Sharpsight. &lsquo;Hey! get up,
Sharpsight! look where the princess is!&rsquo; Sharpsight looked
out for a long time. &lsquo;Oh sir,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;she is a long way
off, a long way off! Three hundred miles off is a black sea,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
and in the midst of the sea a shell on the bottom, and in
the shell is a gold ring, and she&rsquo;s the ring. But never
mind! we shall obtain her, but to-day Long must take
Broad with him as well; we shall want him.&rsquo; Long took
Sharpsight on one shoulder, and Broad on the other, and
went thirty miles at a step. When they came to the black
sea, Sharpsight showed him where he must reach into the
water for the shell. Long extended his hand as far as he
could, but could not reach the bottom.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wait, comrades! wait only a little and I&rsquo;ll help you,&rsquo;
said Broad, and swelled himself out as far as his paunch
would stretch; he then lay down on the shore and drank.
In a very short time the water fell so low that Long easily
reached the bottom and took the shell out of the sea. Out
of it he extracted the ring, took his comrades on his
shoulders, and hastened back. But on the way he found it
a little difficult to run with Broad, who had half a sea of
water inside him, so he cast him from his shoulder on to the
ground in a wide valley. Thump he went like a sack let
fall from a tower, and in a moment the whole valley was
under water like a vast lake. Broad himself barely crawled
out of it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the prince was in great trouble in the castle.
The dawn began to display itself over the mountains, and
his servants had not returned; the more brilliantly the rays
ascended, the greater was his anxiety; a deadly perspiration
came out upon his forehead. Soon the sun showed itself
in the east like a thin strip of flame&mdash;and then with a loud
crash the door flew open, and on the threshold stood the
wizard. He looked round the room, and seeing the
princess was not there, laughed a hateful laugh and entered
the room. But just at that moment, pop! the window flew
in pieces, the gold ring fell on the floor, and in an instant
there stood the princess again. Sharpsight, seeing what was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
going on in the castle, and in what danger his master was,
told Long. Long made a step, and threw the ring through
the window into the room. The wizard roared with rage,
till the castle quaked, and then bang! went the third iron
hoop that was round his waist, and sprang off him; the
wizard turned into a raven, and flew out and away through
the shattered window.</p>

<p>Then, and not till then, did the beautiful damsel speak
and thank the prince for setting her free, and blushed like
a rose. In the castle and round the castle everything
became alive again at once. He who was holding in the hall
the outstretched sword, swung it into the air, which whistled
again, and then returned it to its sheath; he who was
stumbling on the threshold, fell on the ground, but immediately
got up again and felt his nose to see whether it was
still entire; he who was sitting under the chimney put the
piece of meat into his mouth and went on eating; and thus
everybody completed what he had begun doing, and at the
point where he had left off. In the stables the horses
merrily stamped and snorted, the trees round the castle
became green like periwinkles, the meadows were full of
variegated flowers, high in the air warbled the skylark, and
abundance of small fishes appeared in the clear river.
Everywhere was life, everywhere enjoyment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a number of gentlemen assembled in the room
where the prince was, and all thanked him for their liberation.
But he said, &lsquo;You have nothing to thank me for; if
it had not been for my trusty servants Long, Broad, and
Sharpsight, I too should have been what you were.&rsquo; He
then immediately started on his way home to the old king,
his father, with his bride and servants. On the way they
met Broad and took him with them.</p>

<p>The old king wept for joy at the success of his son; he
had thought he would return no more. Soon afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
there was a grand wedding, the festivities of which lasted three
weeks; all the gentlemen that the prince had liberated were
invited. After the wedding Long, Broad, and Sharpsight
announced to the young king that they were going again
into the world to look for work. The young king tried to
persuade them to stay with him. &lsquo;I will give you everything
you want, as long as you live,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;you needn&rsquo;t
work at all.&rsquo; But they didn&rsquo;t like such an idle life, took
leave of him, went away and have been ever since knocking
about somewhere or other in the world.</p>

<hr class="rule" />

<p>This story appears to me to be the perfection of &lsquo;Natural
Science in Allegory.&rsquo; It is not a mere &lsquo;Natur-myth,&rsquo; exhibiting
the contests, victories, and defeats of the forces
of Nature. In interpreting it we must distinguish between
the mere machinery and the essential actors. The king&rsquo;s son
does nothing himself, and the whole work is performed by
the three men, whom he takes into his service. I understand
by the king&rsquo;s son Man, who wishes to cultivate the earth,
who is the princess imprisoned by the enchanter, the drought.
She is released by the agency of the three phenomena
that usher in the rainy season, the rainbow (Long), the
cloud (Broad), and the lightning (Sharpsight). Man, by the aid
of these three phenomena, is enabled to cultivate the earth.
Such a story could only originate in a country of periodic
rains. The rapid recovery of vegetation and almost instantaneous
reappearance of fish in dried-up brooks in India
are well known. The common story of the Sleeping Beauty is
evidently a fragment from the myth which exhibits figuratively
the speedy wake up of all things when released from
the bondage of the drought.</p>

<p>It is possible also to consider the prince as the sun, who
cannot marry the drought-enslaved earth, until he has taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
into his service and obtained the aid of the same three
phenomena. Those who had previously attempted to set
the princess free would then be the suns immediately preceding
the rainy season, which had not had the aid of
Long, Broad, and Sharpsight.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap02" id="chap02"></a>II.&mdash;&lsquo;THE THREE GOLDEN HAIRS OF GRANDFATHER
ALLKNOW.&rsquo;</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once upon a time a king who delighted in
hunting wild animals in forests. One day he chased a stag
to a great distance and lost his way. He was all alone;
night came on, and the king was only too glad to find a
cottage in a clearing. A charcoal-burner lived there. The
king asked him whether he would guide him out of the
forest to the road, promising to pay him well for it. &lsquo;I
would gladly go with you,&rsquo; said the charcoal-burner, &lsquo;but,
you see, my wife is expecting; I cannot go away. And
whither would you go at this time of night? Lie down on
some hay on the garret floor, and to-morrow morning I will
be your guide.&rsquo; Soon afterwards a baby boy was born to
the charcoal-burner. The king was lying on the floor and
couldn&rsquo;t sleep. At midnight he observed a kind of light in
the keeping-room below. He peeped through a chink in the
boarding and saw the charcoal-burner asleep, his wife lying
in a dead faint, and three old hags, all in white, standing by
the baby, each with a lighted taper in her hand. The first
said: &lsquo;My gift to this boy is, that he shall come into great
dangers.&rsquo; The second said: &lsquo;My gift to him is, that he
shall escape from them all and live long.&rsquo; And the third
said: &lsquo;And I give him to wife the baby daughter who has
this day been born to that king who is lying upstairs on the
hay.&rsquo; Thereupon the hags put out their tapers, and all was
still again. They were the Fates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
The king felt as if a sword had been thrust into his
breast. He didn&rsquo;t sleep till morning, thinking over what to
do, and how to do it, to prevent that coming to pass which
he had heard. When day dawned the child began to cry.
The charcoal-burner got up and saw that his wife had gone
to sleep for ever. &lsquo;Oh, my poor little orphan!&rsquo; whimpered
he; &lsquo;what shall I do with you now?&rsquo; &lsquo;Give me the baby,&rsquo;
said the king; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take care that it shall be well with it, and
will give you so much money that you needn&rsquo;t burn charcoal
as long as you live.&rsquo; The charcoal-burner was delighted
at this, and the king promised to send for the baby.
When he arrived at his palace they told him, with great joy,
that a beautiful baby-daughter had been born to him on such
and such a night. It was the very night on which he saw
the three Fates. The king frowned, called one of his
servants, and told him: &lsquo;Go to such a place in the forest; a
charcoal-burner lives there in a cottage. Give him this
money, and he will give you a little child. Take the child
and drown it on your way back. If you don&rsquo;t drown it,
you shall drink water yourself.&rsquo; The servant went, took the
baby and put it into a basket, and when he came to a narrow
foot-bridge, under which flowed a deep and broad river,
he threw the basket and all into the water. &lsquo;Good-night,
uninvited son-in-law!&rsquo; said the king, when the servant told
him what he had done.</p>

<p>The king thought that the baby was drowned, but it
wasn&rsquo;t. It floated in the water in the basket as if it had
been its cradle, and slept as if the river were singing to it, till
it floated down to a fisherman&rsquo;s cottage. The fisherman
was sitting by the bank mending his net. He saw something
floating down the river, jumped into his boat, and
went to catch it, and out of the water he drew the baby in
the basket. He carried it to his wife, and said: &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve
always wanted a little son, and here you have one. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
water has brought him to us.&rsquo; The fisherman&rsquo;s wife was
delighted, and brought up the child as her own. They
named him &lsquo;Floatling&rsquo; (<i>Plav&aacute;czek</i>), because he had floated
to them on the water.</p>

<p>The river flowed on and years passed on, and from a boy
he became a handsome youth, the like of whom was not to
be found far and wide. One day in the summer it came to
pass that the king rode that way all alone. It was hot, and
he was thirsty, and beckoned to the fisherman to give him a
little fresh water. When Floatling brought it to him, the
king looked at him with astonishment. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve a fine lad,
fisherman!&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;is he your son?&rsquo; &lsquo;He is and he
isn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; replied the fisherman; &lsquo;just twenty years ago he
floated, as a little baby, down the river in a basket, and we
brought him up.&rsquo; A mist came before the king&rsquo;s eyes; he
became as pale as a whitewashed wall, perceiving that it was
the child he had ordered to be drowned. But he soon
recollected himself, sprang from his horse, and said: &lsquo;I want
a messenger to my palace, and have nobody with me: can
this youth go thither for me?&rsquo; &lsquo;Your majesty has but to
command and the lad will go,&rsquo; said the fisherman. The
king sat down and wrote a letter to his queen: &lsquo;Cause this
young man whom I send you to be run through with a
sword at once; he is a dangerous enemy of mine. Let it
be done before I return. Such is my will.&rsquo; He then folded
the letter, fastened and sealed it with his signet.</p>

<p>Floatling started at once with the letter. He had to go
through a great forest, but missed the road and lost his way.
He went from thicket to thicket till it began to grow dark.
Then he met an old hag, who said to him: &lsquo;Whither are
you going, Floatling?&rsquo; &lsquo;I am going with a letter to the
king&rsquo;s palace, and have lost my way. Can&rsquo;t you tell me,
mother, how to get into the right road?&rsquo; &lsquo;Anyhow, you
won&rsquo;t get there to-day,&rsquo; said the hag; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s dark. Stay the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
night with me. You won&rsquo;t be with a stranger. I am your
godmother.&rsquo; The young man allowed himself to be persuaded,
and they hadn&rsquo;t gone many paces when they saw
before them a pretty little house, just as if it had grown all
at once out of the ground. In the night, when the lad was
asleep, the hag took the letter out of his pocket and put
another in its place, in which it was written thus: &lsquo;Cause
this young man whom I send you to be married to our
daughter at once; he is my destined son-in-law. Let it be
done before I return. Such is my will.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the queen read the letter, she immediately ordered
arrangements to be made for the wedding, and neither she
nor the young princess could gaze enough at the bridegroom,
so delighted were they with him; and Floatling was similarly
delighted with his royal bride. Some days after, the king
came home, and when he found what had happened, he was
violently enraged at his queen for what she had done.
&lsquo;Anyhow, you ordered me yourself to have him married to
our daughter before you returned,&rsquo; answered the queen, and
gave him the letter. The king took the letter and looked
it through&mdash;writing, seal, paper, everything was his own. He
had his son-in-law called, and questioned him about what
had happened on his way to the palace.</p>

<p>Floatling related how he had started and had lost his way
in the forest, and stayed the night with his old godmother.
&lsquo;What did she look like?&rsquo; &lsquo;So and so.&rsquo; The king perceived
from his statement that it was the same person that
had, twenty years before, assigned his daughter to the charcoal-burner&rsquo;s
son. He thought and thought, and then he
said: &lsquo;What&rsquo;s done can&rsquo;t be altered; still, you can&rsquo;t be my
son-in-law for nothing. If you want to have my daughter,
you must bring me for a dowry three golden hairs of Grandfather
Allknow.&rsquo; He thought to himself that he should thus
be quit of his distasteful son-in-law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
Floatling took leave of his bride and went&mdash;which way,
and whither? I don&rsquo;t know; but, as a Fate was his godmother,
it was easy for him to find the right road. He went
far and wide, over hills and dales, over fords and rivers, till
he came to a black sea. There he saw a boat, and in it a
ferryman. &lsquo;God bless you, old ferryman!&rsquo; &lsquo;God grant it,
young pilgrim! Whither are you travelling?&rsquo; &lsquo;To Grandfather
Allknow, for three golden hairs.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ho, ho! I have
long been waiting for such a messenger. For twenty years
I&rsquo;ve been ferrying here, and nobody&rsquo;s come to set me free.
If you promise me to ask Grandfather Allknow when the
end of my work will be, I will ferry you over.&rsquo; Floatling
promised, and the ferryman ferried him across.</p>

<p>After this he came to a great city, but it was decayed and
sad. In front of the city he met an old man, who had a
staff in his hand, and could scarcely crawl. &lsquo;God bless
you, aged grandfather!&rsquo; &lsquo;God grant it, handsome youth!
Whither are you going?&rsquo; &lsquo;To Grandfather Allknow, for
three golden hairs.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah! ah! we&rsquo;ve long been waiting for
some such messenger; I must at once conduct you to our
lord the king.&rsquo; When they got there the king said: &lsquo;I hear
that you are going on an errand to Grandfather Allknow.
We had an apple-tree here that bore youth-producing apples.
If anybody ate one, though he were on the brink of the grave,
he got young again, and became like a young man. But for
the last twenty years our apple-tree has produced no fruit.
If you promise me to ask Grandfather Allknow whether
there is any help for us, I will requite you royally.&rsquo; Floatling
promised, and the king dismissed him graciously.</p>

<p>After that he came again to another great city, which was
half ruined. Not far from the city a son was burying his
deceased father, and tears, like peas, were rolling down his
cheek. &lsquo;God bless you, mournful grave-digger!&rsquo; said
Floatling. &lsquo;God grant it, good pilgrim! Whither are you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
going?&rsquo; &lsquo;I am going to Grandfather Allknow, for three
golden hairs.&rsquo; &lsquo;To Grandfather Allknow? It&rsquo;s a pity you
didn&rsquo;t come sooner! But our king has long been waiting
for some such messenger; I must conduct you to him.&rsquo;
When they got there, the king said: &lsquo;I hear that you are
going on an errand to Grandfather Allknow. We had a
well here, out of which sprang living water; if anybody
drank it, even were he at the point of death, he would get
well at once; nay, were he already a corpse, if this water
were sprinkled upon him, he would immediately rise up and
walk. But for the last twenty years the water has ceased to
flow. If you promise me to ask Grandfather Allknow
whether there is any help for us, I will give you a royal
reward.&rsquo; Floatling promised, and the king dismissed him
graciously.</p>

<p>After this he went far and wide through a black forest,
and in the midst of that forest espied a large green meadow,
full of beautiful flowers, and in it a golden palace. This was
Grandfather Allknow&rsquo;s palace; it glittered as if on fire.
Floatling went into the palace, but found nobody there but
an old hag sitting and spinning in a corner. &lsquo;Welcome,
Floatling!&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;I am delighted to see you again.&rsquo; It
was his godmother, at whose house he had spent the
night when he was carrying the letter. &lsquo;What has brought
you here?&rsquo; &lsquo;The king would not allow me to be his son-in-law
for nothing, so he sent me for three golden hairs of Grandfather
Allknow.&rsquo; The hag smiled, and said: &lsquo;Grandfather
Allknow is my son, the bright Sun; in the morning he is a
little lad, at noon a grown man, and in the evening an old
grandfather. I will provide you with the three golden hairs
from his golden head, that I too mayn&rsquo;t be your godmother
for nothing. But, my boy! you can&rsquo;t remain as you are.
My son is certainly a good soul, but when he comes home
hungry in the evening, it might easily happen that he might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
roast and eat you for his supper. Yonder is an empty tub;
I will cover you over with it.&rsquo; Floatling begged her also to
question Grandfather Allknow about the three things concerning
which he had promised on the road to bring answers.
&lsquo;I will,&rsquo; said the hag, &lsquo;and do you give heed to what he
says.&rsquo;</p>

<p>All at once a wind arose outside and in flew the Sun, an
old grandfather with a golden head, by the west window into
the room. &lsquo;A smell, a smell of human flesh!&rsquo; says he;
&lsquo;have you anybody here, mother?&rsquo; &lsquo;Star of the day!
whom could I have here without your seeing him? But so
it is; you&rsquo;re all day long flying over God&rsquo;s world, and your
nose is filled with the scent of human flesh; so it&rsquo;s no wonder
that you still smell it when you come home in the evening.&rsquo;
The old man said nothing in reply, and sat down to his
supper.</p>

<p>After supper he laid his golden head on the hag&rsquo;s lap and
began to slumber. As soon as she saw that he was sound
asleep, she pulled out a golden hair and threw it on the
ground. It rang like a harp-string. &lsquo;What do you want,
mother?&rsquo; said the old man. &lsquo;Nothing, sonny, nothing! I
was asleep, and had a marvellous dream.&rsquo; &lsquo;What did you
dream about?&rsquo; &lsquo;I dreamt about a city, where they had a
spring of living water; when anybody was ill and drank of
it, he got well again; and if he died and was sprinkled with
this water, he came to life again. But for the last twenty
years the water has ceased to flow; is there any help that it
may flow again?&rsquo; &lsquo;Quite easy; there&rsquo;s a toad sitting on the
spring in the well that won&rsquo;t let the water flow. Let them
kill the toad and clean out the well; the water will flow as
before.&rsquo; When the old man fell asleep again, the hag pulled
out a second golden hair and threw it on the ground. &lsquo;What
ails you again, mother?&rsquo; &lsquo;Nothing, sonny, nothing; I was
asleep, and again had a marvellous dream. I dreamt of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
city where they had an apple-tree which bore youth-restoring
apples; when anybody grew old and ate one he became
young again. But for the last twenty years the apple-tree has
borne no fruit; is there any help?&rsquo; &lsquo;Quite easy; under
the tree there lies a snake that exhausts its powers; let them
kill the snake and transplant the apple-tree; it will bear
fruit as before.&rsquo; The old man then fell asleep again, and
the hag pulled out a third golden hair. &lsquo;Why won&rsquo;t you
let me sleep, mother?&rsquo; said the old man crossly, and wanted
to get up. &lsquo;Lie still, sonny, lie still! Don&rsquo;t be angry, I
didn&rsquo;t want to wake you. But a heavy sleep fell upon me,
and I had another marvellous dream. I dreamt of a ferryman
on a black sea; for twenty years he has been ferrying
across it, and no one has come to set him free. When will
his work have an end?&rsquo; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s the son of a stupid mother.
Let him give the oar into another person&rsquo;s hand and jump
ashore himself; the other will be ferryman in his stead.
But let me be quiet now; I must get up early to-morrow
and go to dry the tears which the king&rsquo;s daughter sheds
every night for her husband, the charcoal-burner&rsquo;s son,
whom the king has sent for three golden hairs of mine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In the morning a wind again arose outside, and on the lap
of its old mother awoke, instead of the old man, a beautiful
golden-haired child, the divine Sun, who bade farewell to his
mother and flew out by the east window. The hag turned
up the tub and said to Floatling: &lsquo;There are the three
golden hairs for you, and you also know what Grandfather
Allknow has answered to those three things. Go; and good-bye!
You will see me no more; there is no need of it.&rsquo;
Floatling thanked the hag gratefully, and departed.</p>

<p>When he came to the first city, the king asked him what
news he brought him. &lsquo;Good news,&rsquo; said Floatling. &lsquo;Have
the well cleaned out, and kill the toad which sits on the
spring, and the water will flow again as aforetime.&rsquo; The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
king had this done without delay, and when he saw the water
bubbling up with a full stream, he presented Floatling with
twelve horses white as swans, and on them as much gold and
silver as they could carry.</p>

<p>When he came to the second city the king asked him again
what news he brought. &lsquo;Good news!&rsquo; said Floatling. &lsquo;Have
the apple-tree dug up; you will find a snake under the roots;
kill it; then plant the apple-tree again, and it will bear fruit
as aforetime.&rsquo; The king had this done at once, and during
the night the apple-tree was clothed with bloom, just as if it
had been bestrewn with roses. The king was delighted,
and presented Floatling with twelve horses as black as
ravens, and on them as much riches as they could carry.</p>

<p>Floatling travelled on, and when he came to the black sea,
the ferryman asked him whether he had learnt when he would
be liberated. &lsquo;I have,&rsquo; said Floatling. &lsquo;But ferry me over
first, and then I will tell you.&rsquo; The ferryman objected, but
when he saw that there was nothing else to be done, he
ferried him over with his four-and-twenty horses. &lsquo;Before
you ferry anybody over again,&rsquo; said Floatling, &lsquo;put the oar
into his hand and jump ashore, and he will be ferryman in
your stead.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The king didn&rsquo;t believe his eyes when Floatling brought
him the three golden hairs of Grandfather Allknow; and
his daughter wept, not from sorrow, but from joy at his
return. &lsquo;But where did you get these beautiful horses and
this great wealth?&rsquo; asked the king. &lsquo;I earned it,&rsquo; said
Floatling; and related how he had helped one king again to
the youth-restoring apples, which make young people out of
old ones; and another to the living water, which makes sick
people well and dead people living. &lsquo;Youth-restoring
apples! living water!&rsquo; repeated the king quietly to himself.
&lsquo;If I ate one I should become young again; and if I died I
should be restored to life by that water.&rsquo; Without delay he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
started on the road for the youth-restoring apples and the
living water&mdash;and hasn&rsquo;t returned yet.</p>

<p>Thus the charcoal-burner&rsquo;s son became the king&rsquo;s son-in-law,
as the Fate decreed; and as for the king, maybe he is
still ferrying across the black sea.</p>

<p>This story is a variant of Grimm&rsquo;s &lsquo;Giant with the Three
Golden Hairs.&rsquo; But, whereas in Grimm there is nothing to
indicate who the giant is, or whether he has three golden
hairs and three only, in the Bohemian tale it is plain that
&lsquo;Grandfather Allknow&rsquo; is the Sun, and that the three
golden hairs are three sunbeams.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap03" id="chap03"></a>III.&mdash;GOLDENHAIR.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a king who was so clever that he understood all
animals, and knew what they said to each other. Hear how
he learnt it. Once upon a time there came to him a little
old woman, who brought him a snake in a basket, and told
him to have it cooked for him; if he dined off it, he would
understand what any animal in the air, on the earth, or in the
water said. The king liked the idea of understanding what
nobody else understood, paid the old woman well, and forthwith
ordered his servant to cook the fish for dinner. &lsquo;But,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;be sure you don&rsquo;t take a morsel of it even on your
tongue, else you shall pay for it with your head.&rsquo;</p>

<p>George, the servant, thought it odd that the king forbade
him so energetically to do this. &lsquo;In my life I never saw
such a fish,&rsquo; said he to himself; &lsquo;it looks just like a snake!
And what sort of cook would that be who didn&rsquo;t take a taste
of what he was cooking?&rsquo; When it was cooked, he took a
morsel on his tongue, and tasted it. Thereupon he heard
something buzzing round his ears: &lsquo;Some for us, too!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
some for us, too!&rsquo; George looked round, and saw nothing
but some flies that were flying about in the kitchen. Again
somebody called with a hissing voice in the street outside:
&lsquo;Where are you going? where are you going?&rsquo; And shriller
voices answered: &lsquo;To the miller&rsquo;s barley! to the miller&rsquo;s
barley!&rsquo; George peeped through the window, and saw a
gander and a flock of geese. &lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s the
kind of fish it is.&rsquo; Now he knew what it was. He hastily
thrust one more morsel into his mouth, and carried the snake
to the king as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>After dinner the king ordered George to saddle the horses
and accompany him, as he wished to take a ride. The
king rode in front and George behind. As they were riding
over a green meadow, George&rsquo;s horse bounded and began to
neigh. &lsquo;Ho! ho! brother. I feel so light that I should
like to jump over mountains!&rsquo; &lsquo;As for that,&rsquo; said the other,
&lsquo;I should like to jump about, too, but there&rsquo;s an old man on
my back; if I were to skip, he&rsquo;d tumble on the ground like
a sack and break his neck.&rsquo; &lsquo;Let him break it&mdash;what
matter?&rsquo; said George&rsquo;s horse; &lsquo;instead of an old man you&rsquo;ll
carry a young one.&rsquo; George laughed heartily at this conversation,
but so quietly that the king knew nothing about it.
But the king also understood perfectly well what the horses
were saying to each other, looked round, and seeing a smile
on George&rsquo;s face, asked him what he was laughing at.
&lsquo;Nothing, your illustrious majesty,&rsquo; said George in excuse;
&lsquo;only something occurred to my mind.&rsquo; Nevertheless, the
old king already suspected him, neither did he feel confidence
in the horses, so he turned and rode back home.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the palace, the king ordered George
to pour him out a glass of wine. &lsquo;But your head for it,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;if you don&rsquo;t pour it full, or if you pour it so that it
runs over.&rsquo; George took the decanter and poured. Just
then in flew two birds through the window; one was chasing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
the other, and the one that was trying to get away carried
three golden hairs in its beak. &lsquo;Give them to me!&rsquo; said the
first; &lsquo;they are mine.&rsquo; &lsquo;I shan&rsquo;t; they&rsquo;re mine; I took them
up.&rsquo; &lsquo;But I saw them fall, when the golden-haired maiden
was combing her hair. At any rate, give me two.&rsquo; &lsquo;Not
one!&rsquo; Hereupon the other bird made a rush, and seized the
golden hairs. As they struggled for them on the wing, one
remained in each bird&rsquo;s beak, and the third golden hair fell
on the ground, where it rang again. At this moment George
looked round at it, and then poured the wine over. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve
forfeited your life!&rsquo; shouted the king; &lsquo;but I&rsquo;ll deal mercifully
with you if you obtain the golden-haired maiden, and bring
her me to wife.&rsquo;</p>

<p>What was George to do? If he wanted to save his life,
he must go in search of the maiden, though he did not know
where to look for her. He saddled his horse, and rode at
random. He came to a black forest, and there, under the
forest by the roadside, a bush was burning; some cowherd
had set it on fire. Under the bush was an ant-hill; sparks
were falling on it, and the ants were fleeing in all directions
with their little white eggs. &lsquo;Help, George, help!&rsquo;
cried they mournfully; &lsquo;we&rsquo;re being burnt to death, as well
as our young ones in the eggs.&rsquo; He got down from his horse
at once, cut away the bush, and put out the fire. &lsquo;When
you are in trouble think of us, and we&rsquo;ll help you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He rode on through the forest, and came to a lofty pine.
On the top of this pine was a raven&rsquo;s nest, and below, on
the ground, were two young ravens crying and complaining:
&lsquo;Our father and mother have flown away; we&rsquo;ve got
to seek food for ourselves, and we poor little birds can&rsquo;t
fly yet. Help us, George, help us! Feed us, or we shall
die of hunger!&rsquo; George did not stop long to consider, but
jumped down from his horse, and thrust his sword into
its side, that the young ravens might have something to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
eat. &lsquo;When you are in need think of us, and we&rsquo;ll help
you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>After this, George had to go on on foot. He walked a
long, long way through the forest, and when he at last got
out of it, he saw before him a long and broad sea. On the
shore of this sea two fishermen were quarrelling. They
had caught a large golden fish in their net, and each
wanted to have it for himself. &lsquo;The net is mine, and
mine&rsquo;s the fish.&rsquo; The other replied: &lsquo;Much good would
your net have been, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for my boat and my
help.&rsquo; &lsquo;If we catch such another fish again, it will be
yours.&rsquo; &lsquo;Not so; wait you for the next, and give me this.&rsquo;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll set you at one,&rsquo; said George. &lsquo;Sell me the fish&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
pay you well for it&mdash;and you divide the money between
you, share and share alike.&rsquo; He gave them all the money
that the king had given him for his journey, leaving nothing
at all for himself. The fishermen were delighted, and
George let the fish go again into the sea. It splashed
merrily through the water, dived, and then, not far from
the shore, put out its head: &lsquo;When you want me, George,
think of me, and I&rsquo;ll requite you.&rsquo; It then disappeared.
&lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo; the fishermen asked George.
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going for the golden-haired maiden to be the bride of
the old king, my lord, and I don&rsquo;t even know where to look
for her.&rsquo; &lsquo;We can tell you all about her,&rsquo; said the fishermen.
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s Goldenhair, the king&rsquo;s daughter, of the
Crystal Palace, on the island yonder. Every day at dawn
she combs her golden hair, and the bright gleam therefrom
goes over sky and over sea. If you wish it, we&rsquo;ll take you
over to the island ourselves, as you set us at one again so
nicely. But take care to bring away the right maiden; there
are twelve maidens&mdash;the king&rsquo;s daughters&mdash;but only one has
golden hair.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When George was on the island, he went into the Crystal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
Palace to entreat the king to give the king, his lord, his
golden-haired daughter to wife. &lsquo;I will,&rsquo; said the king,
&lsquo;but you must earn her; you must in three days perform
three tasks, which I shall impose upon you, each day
one. Meanwhile, you can rest till to-morrow.&rsquo; Next
day, early, the king said to him: &lsquo;My Goldenhair had
a necklace of costly pearls; the necklace broke, and
the pearls were scattered in the long grass in the green
meadow. You must collect all these pearls, without one
being wanting.&rsquo; George went into the meadow; it was long
and broad; he knelt on the grass, and began to seek. He
sought and sought from morn to noon, but never saw a
pearl. &lsquo;Ah! if my ants were here, they might help me.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Here we are to help you,&rsquo; said the ants, running in every
direction, but always crowding round him. &lsquo;What do you
want?&rsquo; &lsquo;I have to collect pearls in this meadow, but I
don&rsquo;t see one.&rsquo; &lsquo;Only wait a bit, we&rsquo;ll collect them for
you.&rsquo; Before long they brought him a multitude of pearls
out of the grass, and he had nothing to do but string
them on the necklace. Afterwards, when he was going to
fasten up the necklace, one more ant limped up&mdash;it was
lame, its foot had been scorched when the fire was at the
ant-hill&mdash;and cried out: &lsquo;Stop, George, don&rsquo;t fasten it up;
I&rsquo;m bringing you one more pearl.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When George brought the pearls to the king, the king
counted them over; not one was wanting. &lsquo;You have
done your business well,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;to-morrow I shall give
you another piece of work.&rsquo; In the morning George came,
and the king said to him: &lsquo;My Goldenhair was bathing
in the sea, and lost there a gold ring; you must find and
bring it.&rsquo; George went to the sea, and walked sorrowfully
along the shore. The sea was clear, but so deep that he
couldn&rsquo;t even see the bottom, much less could he seek
and find the ring there. &lsquo;Oh that my golden fish were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
here; it might be able to help me.&rsquo; Whereupon something
glittered in the sea, and up swam the golden fish
from the deep to the surface of the water: &lsquo;Here I am to
help you; what do you want?&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got to find a gold
ring in the sea, and I can&rsquo;t even see the bottom.&rsquo; &lsquo;I
just met a pike which was carrying a gold ring in its
mouth. Only wait a bit, I&rsquo;ll bring it to you.&rsquo; Ere long it
returned from the deep water, and brought him the pike,
ring and all.</p>

<p>The king commended George for doing his business
well, and then next morning laid upon him the third task:
&lsquo;If you wish me to give your king my Goldenhair to wife,
you must bring her the waters of death and of life&mdash;she will
require them.&rsquo; George did not know whither to betake
himself for these waters, and went at haphazard hither and
thither, whither his feet carried him, till he came to a black
forest: &lsquo;Ah, if my young ravens were here, perhaps they
would help me.&rsquo; Now there was a rustling over his
head, and two young ravens appeared above him: &lsquo;Here
we are to help you; what do you wish?&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got to
bring the waters of death and of life, and I don&rsquo;t know
where to look for them.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, we know them well; only
wait a bit, we&rsquo;ll bring them to you.&rsquo; After a short time
they each brought George a bottle-gourd full of water; in
the one gourd was the water of life, in the other the water
of death. George was delighted with his good fortune, and
hastened to the castle. At the edge of the forest he saw a
cobweb extending from one pine-tree to another; in the
midst of the cobweb sat a large spider sucking a fly.
George took the bottle with the water of death, sprinkled
the spider, and the spider dropped to the ground like a ripe
cherry&mdash;he was dead. He then sprinkled the fly with the
water of life out of the other bottle, and the fly began to
move, extricated itself from the cobweb, and off into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
air. &lsquo;Lucky for you, George, that you&rsquo;ve brought me to
life again,&rsquo; it buzzed round his ears; &lsquo;without me you&rsquo;d
scarcely guess aright which of the twelve is Goldenhair.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the king saw that George had completed this matter
also, he said he would give him his golden-haired daughter.
&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you must select her yourself.&rsquo; He then led
him into a great hall, in the midst of which was a round
table, and round the table sat twelve beautiful maidens, one
like the other; but each had on her head a long kerchief
reaching down to the ground, white as snow, so that it
couldn&rsquo;t be seen what manner of hair any of them had.
&lsquo;Here are my daughters,&rsquo; said the king; &lsquo;if you guess
which of them is Goldenhair, you have won her, and can
take her away at once; but if you don&rsquo;t guess right, she is
not adjudged to you, you must depart without her.&rsquo; George
was in the greatest anxiety; he didn&rsquo;t know what to do.
Whereupon something whispered into his ear: &lsquo;Buzz!
buzz! go round the table, I&rsquo;ll tell you which is the one.&rsquo; It
was the fly that George had restored to life with the water of
life. &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t this maiden&mdash;nor this&mdash;nor this; this is
Goldenhair!&rsquo; &lsquo;Give me this one of your daughters,&rsquo; cried
George; &lsquo;I have earned her for my lord.&rsquo; &lsquo;You have
guessed right,&rsquo; said the king; and the maiden at once rose
from the table, threw off her kerchief, and her golden hair
flowed in streams from her head to the ground, and such a
brightness came from them, even as when the sun rises in
the morning, that George&rsquo;s eyes were dazzled.</p>

<p>Then the king gave his daughter all that was fitting for
her journey, and George took her away to be his lord&rsquo;s
bride. The old king&rsquo;s eyes sparkled, and he jumped for
joy, when he saw Goldenhair, and gave orders at once for
preparations to be made for the wedding. &lsquo;I intended to
have you hanged for your disobedience, that the ravens
might devour you,&rsquo; said he to George; &lsquo;but you have served
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
me so well, that I shall only have your head cut off with an
axe, and then I shall have you honourably buried.&rsquo; When
George had been executed, Goldenhair begged the old king
to grant her the body of his dead servant, and the king
couldn&rsquo;t deny his golden-haired bride anything. She then
fitted George&rsquo;s head to his body, and sprinkled him with
the water of death, and the body and head grew together so
that no mark of the wound remained. Then she sprinkled
him with the water of life, and George rose up again, as if
he had been born anew, as fresh as a stag, and youth
beamed from his countenance. &lsquo;Oh, how heavily I have
slept!&rsquo; said George, and rubbed his eyes. &lsquo;Yes, indeed,
you have slept heavily,&rsquo; said Goldenhair; &lsquo;and if it hadn&rsquo;t
been for me, you wouldn&rsquo;t have waked for ever and ever.&rsquo;
When the old king saw that George had come to life again,
and that he was younger and handsomer than before, he
wanted to be made young again also. He gave orders at
once that his head should be cut off, and that he should be
sprinkled with the water. They cut his head off and
sprinkled him with the water of life, till they&rsquo;d sprinkled it
all away; but his head wouldn&rsquo;t grow on to the body. Then,
and not till then, did they begin to sprinkle him with the
water of death, and in an instant the head grew on to the
body; but the king was dead all the same, because they
had no more of the water of life to bring him to life again.
And since the kingdom couldn&rsquo;t be without a king, and
they&rsquo;d no one so intelligent as to understand all animals like
George, they made George king and Goldenhair queen.</p>

Grimm&rsquo;s &lsquo;White Snake.&rsquo; The two kinds of water, that of
death and that of life, appear here, showing that it is a true
Slavonic, and not a Teutonic story.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap04" id="chap04"></a>IV.&mdash;INTELLIGENCE AND LUCK.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time Luck met Intelligence on a garden-seat.
&lsquo;Make room for me!&rsquo; said Luck. Intelligence was then as
yet inexperienced, and didn&rsquo;t know who ought to make room
for whom. He said: &lsquo;Why should I make room for you?
you&rsquo;re no better than I am.&rsquo; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s the better man,&rsquo;
answered Luck, &lsquo;who performs most. See you there yon
peasant&rsquo;s son who&rsquo;s ploughing in the field? Enter into him,
and if he gets on better through you than through me, I&rsquo;ll
always submissively make way for you, whensoever and
wheresoever we meet.&rsquo; Intelligence agreed, and entered at
once into the ploughboy&rsquo;s head. As soon as the ploughboy
felt that he had intelligence in his head, he began to think:
&lsquo;Why must I follow the plough to the day of my death? I
can go somewhere else and make my fortune more easily.&rsquo;
He left off ploughing, put up the plough, and drove home.
&lsquo;Daddy,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like this peasant&rsquo;s life; I&rsquo;d rather
learn to be a gardener.&rsquo; His father said: &lsquo;What ails you,
Vanek? have you lost your wits?&rsquo; However, he bethought
himself, and said: &lsquo;Well, if you will, learn, and God be with
you! Your brother will be heir to the cottage after me.&rsquo;
Vanek lost the cottage, but he didn&rsquo;t care for that, but went
and put himself apprentice to the king&rsquo;s gardener. For
every little that the gardener showed him, Vanek comprehended
ever so much more. Ere long he didn&rsquo;t even obey
the gardener&rsquo;s orders as to how he ought to do anything,
but did everything his own way. At first the gardener was
angry, but, seeing everything thus getting on better, he was
content. &lsquo;I see that you&rsquo;ve more intelligence than I,&rsquo;
said he, and henceforth let Vanek garden as he thought fit.
In no long space of time Vanek made the garden so beautiful,
that the king took great delight in it, and frequently
walked in it with the queen and with his only daughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
The princess was a very beautiful damsel, but ever since she
was twelve years old she had ceased speaking, and no one
ever heard a single word from her. The king was much
grieved, and caused proclamation to be made, that whoever
should bring it to pass that she should speak again,
should be her husband. Many young kings, princes and
other great lords announced themselves one after the other,
but all went away as they had come; no one succeeded in
causing her to speak. &lsquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I too try my luck?&rsquo;
thought Vanek; &lsquo;who knows whether I mayn&rsquo;t succeed in
bringing her to answer when I ask her a question?&rsquo; He at
once caused himself to be announced at the palace, and the
king and his councillors conducted him into the room where
the princess was. The king&rsquo;s daughter had a pretty little dog,
and was very fond of him because he was so clever, understanding
everything that she wanted. When Vanek went
into the room with the king and his councillors, he made as
if he didn&rsquo;t even see the princess, but turned to the dog and
said: &lsquo;I have heard, doggie, that you are very clever, and I
come to you for advice. We are three companions in
travel, a sculptor, a tailor and myself. Once upon a time
we were going through a forest and were obliged to pass the
night in it. To be safe from wolves, we made a fire, and
agreed to keep watch one after the other. The sculptor
kept watch first, and for amusement to kill time took a log
and carved a damsel out of it. When it was finished he
woke the tailor to keep watch in his turn. The tailor,
seeing the wooden damsel, asked what it meant. &ldquo;As you
see,&rdquo; said the sculptor, &ldquo;I was weary, and didn&rsquo;t know what
to do with myself, so I carved a damsel out of a log; if you
find time hang heavy on your hands, you can dress her.&rdquo;
The tailor at once took out his scissors, needle and thread,
cut out the clothes, stitched away, and when they were
ready, dressed the damsel in them. He then called me to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
come and keep watch. I, too, asked him what the meaning
of all this was. &ldquo;As you see,&rdquo; said the tailor, &ldquo;the sculptor
found time hang heavy on his hands and carved a damsel
out of a log, and I for the same reason clothed her; and if
you find time hanging on your hands, you can teach her to
speak.&rdquo; And by morning dawn I had actually taught her to
speak. But in the morning when my companions woke up,
each wanted to possess the damsel. The sculptor said, &ldquo;I
made her;&rdquo; the tailor, &ldquo;I clothed her.&rdquo; I, too, maintained
my right. Tell me, therefore, doggie, to which of us the
damsel belongs?&rsquo; The dog said nothing, but instead of the
dog the princess replied: &lsquo;To whom can she belong but to
yourself? What&rsquo;s the good of the sculptor&rsquo;s damsel without
life? What&rsquo;s the good of the tailor&rsquo;s dressing without
speech? You gave her the best gift, life and speech, and
therefore she by right belongs to you.&rsquo; &lsquo;You have passed
your own sentence,&rsquo; said Vanek; &lsquo;I have given you speech
again and a new life, and you therefore by right belong to
me.&rsquo; Then said one of the king&rsquo;s councillors: &lsquo;His Royal
Grace will give you a plenteous reward for succeeding in
unloosing his daughter&rsquo;s tongue; but you cannot have her
to wife, as you are of mean lineage.&rsquo; The king said: &lsquo;You
are of mean lineage; I will give you a plenteous reward
instead of our daughter.&rsquo; But Vanek wouldn&rsquo;t hear of any
other reward, and said: &lsquo;The king promised without any
exception, that whoever caused his daughter to speak again
should be her husband. A king&rsquo;s word is a law; and if the
king wants others to observe his laws, he must first keep
them himself. Therefore the king <em>must</em> give me his
daughter.&rsquo; &lsquo;Seize and bind him!&rsquo; shouted the councillor.
&lsquo;Whoever says the king <em>must</em> do anything, offers an insult to
his Majesty, and is worthy of death. May it please your
Majesty to order this malefactor to be executed with the
sword?&rsquo; The king said: &lsquo;Let him be executed.&rsquo; Vanek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
was immediately bound and led to execution. When they
came to the place of execution Luck was there waiting for
him, and said secretly to Intelligence, &lsquo;See how this man
has got on through you, till he has to lose his head! Make
way, and let me take your place!&rsquo; As soon as Luck entered
Vanek, the executioner&rsquo;s sword broke against the scaffold,
just as if someone had snapped it; and before they
brought him another, up rode a trumpeter on horseback
from the city, galloping as swift as a bird, trumpeted
merrily, and waved a white flag, and after him came the
royal carriage for Vanek. This is what had happened: The
princess had told her father at home that Vanek had but
spoken the truth, and the king&rsquo;s word ought not to be
broken. If Vanek were of mean lineage the king could
easily make him a prince. The king said: &lsquo;You&rsquo;re right;
let him be a prince!&rsquo; The royal carriage was immediately
sent for Vanek, and the councillor who had irritated the
king against him was executed in his stead. Afterwards,
when Vanek and the princess were going together in a
carriage from the wedding, Intelligence happened to be
somewhere on the road, and seeing that he couldn&rsquo;t help
meeting Luck, bent his head and slipped on one side, just as
if cold water had been thrown upon him. And from that
time forth it is said that Intelligence has always given a wide
berth to Luck whenever he has had to meet him.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap05" id="chap05"></a>V.&mdash;THE JEZINKAS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a poor orphan lad who had neither father
nor mother, and was compelled to go out to service to get
his living. He travelled a long way without being able to
obtain an engagement, till one day he came to a hovel all by
itself under a wood. On the threshold sat an old man, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
had dark caverns in his head instead of eyes. The goats
were bleating in the stall, and the old man said: &lsquo;I wish
I could take you, poor goats, to pasture, but I can&rsquo;t, I am
blind; and I have nobody to send with you.&rsquo; &lsquo;Daddy, send
me,&rsquo; answered the lad; &lsquo;I will pasture your goats, and also
be glad to wait upon you.&rsquo; &lsquo;Who are you? and what is your
name?&rsquo; The lad told him all, and that they called him
Johnny. &lsquo;Well, Johnny, I will take you; but drive out the
goats for me to pasture first of all. But don&rsquo;t lead them to
yon hill in the forest; the Jezinkas will come to you, will put
you to sleep, and will then tear out your eyes, as they have
mine.&rsquo; &lsquo;Never fear, Daddy,&rsquo; answered Johnny; &lsquo;the Jezinkas
won&rsquo;t tear out <em>my</em> eyes.&rsquo; He then let the goats out of the
stall, and drove them to pasture. The first and second day
he pastured them under the forest, but the third day he said
to himself: &lsquo;Why should I be afraid of the Jezinkas? I&rsquo;ll
drive them where there is better pasture.&rsquo; He then broke off
three green shoots of bramble, put them into his hat, and
drove the goats straight on to the hill in the forest. There
the goats wandered about for pasture, and Johnny sat down
on a stone in the cool. He had not sat long, when all of a
sudden, how it came about he knew not, a beautiful damsel
stood before him, all dressed in white, with her hair&mdash;raven-black&mdash;prettily
dressed and flowing down her back, and eyes
like sloes. &lsquo;God bless you, young goatherd!&rsquo; said she.
&lsquo;See what apples grow in our garden! Here&rsquo;s one for you;
I&rsquo;ll give it you, that you may know how good they are.&rsquo;
She offered him a beautiful rosy apple. But Johnny knew
that if he took the apple and ate it he would fall asleep, and
she would afterwards tear out his eyes, so he said: &lsquo;I am
much obliged to you, beautiful damsel! My master has an
apple-tree in his garden, on which still handsomer apples
grow; I have eaten my fill of them.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, if you&rsquo;d rather
not, I won&rsquo;t compel you,&rsquo; said the damsel, and went away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
After a while came another, still prettier, damsel, with a
beautiful red rose in her hand, and said: &lsquo;God bless you,
young goatherd! See what a beautiful rose I&rsquo;ve just plucked
off the hedge. It smells so nice; smell it yourself.&rsquo; &lsquo;I am
much obliged to you, beautiful damsel. My master has still
handsomer roses in his garden; I have smelt my fill of
them.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, then, if you won&rsquo;t, let it alone!&rsquo; said the
damsel, quite enraged, turned round, and retired. After
a while, a third damsel, the youngest and prettiest of them
all, came up. &lsquo;God bless you, young goatherd!&rsquo; &lsquo;Thank
you, beautiful damsel!&rsquo; &lsquo;Indeed, you&rsquo;re a fine lad,&rsquo; said
the damsel, &lsquo;but you&rsquo;d be still handsomer if you had your
hair nicely combed and dressed. Come, I&rsquo;ll comb it for
you.&rsquo; Johnny said nothing, but when the damsel came up
to him to comb his hair, he took his hat from his head,
drew out a bramble-shoot, and pop! struck her on both
hands. The damsel screamed &lsquo;Help, help!&rsquo; began to weep,
but was unable to move from the place. Johnny cared
naught for her weeping, and bound her hands together with
the bramble. Then up ran the other two damsels, and,
seeing their sister a captive, began to beg Johnny to unbind
her and let her go. &lsquo;Unbind her yourselves,&rsquo; said Johnny.
&lsquo;Alas! we can&rsquo;t, we have tender hands, we should prick
ourselves.&rsquo; But when they saw that the lad would not do
as they wished, they went to their sister and wanted to unfasten
the bramble. Thereupon Johnny leapt up, and pop!
pop! struck them too with a spray, and then bound both
their hands together. &lsquo;See, I&rsquo;ve got you, you wicked
Jezinkas! Why did you tear out my master&rsquo;s eyes?&rsquo;
After this, he went home to his master, and said,
&lsquo;Come, daddy, I&rsquo;ve found somebody who will give you
your eyes again.&rsquo; When they came to the hill, he said
to the first Jezinka, &lsquo;Now tell me where the old man&rsquo;s
eyes are. If you don&rsquo;t tell me, I shall throw you at once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
into the water.&rsquo; The Jezinka made excuse that she didn&rsquo;t
know, and Johnny was going to throw her into the river,
which flowed hard by under the hill. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, Johnny,
don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; entreated the Jezinka, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll give you the old
man&rsquo;s eyes.&rsquo; She conducted him into a cavern, where was
a great heap of eyes, large and small, black, red, blue and
green, and took two out of the heap. But when Johnny
placed them in the old man&rsquo;s sockets, the poor man began
to cry: &lsquo;Alas, alas! these are not my eyes. I see nothing
but owls.&rsquo; Johnny became exasperated, seized the Jezinka,
and threw her into the water. He then said to the second:
&lsquo;Tell me, you, where the old man&rsquo;s eyes are.&rsquo; She, too,
began to make excuses that she didn&rsquo;t know; but when the
lad threatened to throw her, too, into the water, she led him
again to the cavern, and took out two other eyes. But the
old man cried again: &lsquo;Alas! these are not my eyes. I see
nothing but wolves.&rsquo; The same was done to the second
Jezinka as to the first; the water closed over her. &lsquo;Tell
me, you, where the old man&rsquo;s eyes are,&rsquo; said Johnny to the
third and youngest Jezinka. She, too, led him to the heap
in the cavern, and took out two eyes for him. But when
they were inserted, the old man cried out again that they
were not his eyes. &lsquo;I see nothing but pike.&rsquo; Johnny saw
that she, too, was cheating him, and was going to drown
her as well; but the Jezinka besought him with tears:
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, Johnny, don&rsquo;t! I will give you the old man&rsquo;s
proper eyes.&rsquo; She took them from under the whole heap.
And when Johnny inserted them into the old man&rsquo;s sockets,
he cried out joyfully: &lsquo;These, these are my eyes! Praise
be to God! now I see well again!&rsquo; Afterwards Johnny
and the old man lived together happily; Johnny pastured
the goats, and the old man made cheeses at home, and they
ate them together; but the Jezinka never showed herself
again on that hill.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap06" id="chap06"></a>VI.&mdash;THE WOOD-LADY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> was a little girl; her mother was a widow, and had
no more of her property left than a dilapidated cottage and
two she-goats; but Betty was, nevertheless, always cheerful.
From spring to autumn she pastured the goats in the birch-wood.
Whenever she went from home, her mother always
gave her in a basket a slice of bread and a spindle, with the
injunction, &lsquo;Let it be full.&rsquo; As she had no distaff, she used
to twine the flax round her head. Betty took the basket,
and skipped off singing merrily after the goats to the birch-wood.
When she got there, the goats went after pasture,
and Betty sat under a tree, drew the fibres from her head
with her left hand, and let down the spindle with her right
so that it just hummed over the ground, and therewith she
sang till the wood echoed; the goats meanwhile pastured.
When the sun indicated mid-day, she put aside her spindle,
called the goats, and after giving them each a morsel of bread
that they mightn&rsquo;t stray from her, bounded into the wood
for a few strawberries or any other woodland fruit that might
happen to be just then in season, that she might have dessert
to her bread. When she had finished her meal, she sprang
up, folded her hands, danced and sang. The sun smiled
on her through the green foliage, and the goats, enjoying
themselves among the grass, thought: &lsquo;What a merry shepherdess
we have!&rsquo; After her dance, she spun again industriously,
and at even, when she drove the goats home, her
mother never scolded her for bringing back her spindle empty.</p>

<p>Once, when according to custom, exactly at mid-day, after
her scanty dinner, she was getting ready for a dance, all of
a sudden&mdash;where she came, there she came&mdash;a very beautiful
maiden stood before her. She had on a white dress as
fine as gossamer, golden-coloured hair flowed from her head
to her waist, and on her head she wore a garland of woodland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
flowers. Betty was struck dumb with astonishment.
The maiden smiled at her, and said in an attractive voice,
&lsquo;Betty, are you fond of dancing?&rsquo; When the maiden spoke
so prettily to her, Betty&rsquo;s terror quitted her, and she answered,
&lsquo;Oh, I should like to dance all day long!&rsquo; &lsquo;Come, then,
let&rsquo;s dance together. I&rsquo;ll teach you!&rsquo; So spoke the maiden,
tucked her dress up on one side, took Betty by the waist,
and began to dance with her. As they circled, such delightful
music sounded over their heads, that Betty&rsquo;s heart
skipped within her. The musicians sat on the branches of
the birches in black, ash-coloured, brown, and variegated
coats. It was a company of choice musicians that had
come together at the beck of the beautiful maiden&mdash;nightingales,
larks, linnets, goldfinches, greenfinches, thrushes,
blackbirds, and a very skilful mocking-bird. Betty&rsquo;s cheek
flamed, her eyes glittered, she forgot her task and her goats,
and only gazed at her partner, who twirled before and round
her with the most charming movements, and so lightly that
the grass didn&rsquo;t even bend beneath her delicate foot. They
danced from noon till eve, and Betty&rsquo;s feet were neither
wearied nor painful. Then the beautiful maiden stopped,
the music ceased, and as she came so she disappeared.
Betty looked about her; the sun was setting behind the
wood. She clapped her hands on the top of her head, and,
feeling the unspun flax, remembered that her spindle, which
was lying on the grass, was by no means full. She took the
flax down from her head, and put it with the spindle into
her basket, called the goats, and drove them home. She
did not sing on the way, but bitterly reproached herself for
letting the beautiful maiden delude her, and determined
that if the maiden should come to her again, she would
never listen to her any more. The goats, hearing no merry
song behind them, looked round to see whether their own
shepherdess was really following them. Her mother, too,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
wondered, and asked her daughter whether she was ill, as
she didn&rsquo;t sing. &lsquo;No, mother dear, I&rsquo;m not ill; but my
throat is dry from very singing, and therefore I don&rsquo;t sing,&rsquo;
said Betty in excuse, and went to put away the spindle and
the unspun flax. Knowing that her mother was not in the
habit of reeling up the yarn at once, she intended to make
up the next day what she had neglected to do the first day,
and therefore did not say a word to her mother about the
beautiful maiden.</p>

<p>The next day Betty again drove the goats as usual to the
birch-wood, and sang to herself again merrily. On arriving
at the birch-wood the goats began to pasture, and she sat
under the tree and began to spin industriously, singing to
herself all the time, for work comes better from the hand
while one sings. The sun indicated mid-day. Betty gave
each of the goats a morsel of bread, went off for strawberries,
and after returning began to eat her dinner and chatter with
the goats. &lsquo;Ah, my little goats, I mustn&rsquo;t dance to-day,&rsquo;
sighed she, when after dinner she collected the crumbs from
her lap in her hand and placed them on a stone that the
birds might take them away. &lsquo;And why mustn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;
spoke a pleasing voice, and the beautiful maiden stood beside
her, as if she had dropped from the clouds. Betty was still
more frightened than the first time, and closed her eyes that
she might not even see the maiden; but when the maiden
repeated the question, she answered modestly: &lsquo;Excuse me,
beautiful lady, I can&rsquo;t dance with you, because I should
again fail to perform my task of spinning, and my mother
would scold me. To-day, before the sun sets, I must make
up what I left undone yesterday.&rsquo; &lsquo;Only come and dance;
before the sun sets help will be found for you,&rsquo; said the
maiden, tucked up her dress, took Betty round the waist,
the musicians sitting on the birch branches struck up, and
the two dancers began to whirl. The beautiful maiden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
danced still more enchantingly. Betty couldn&rsquo;t take her
eyes off her, and forgot the goats and her task. At last the
dancer stopped, the music ceased, the sun was on the verge
of setting. Betty clapped her hand on the top of her head,
where the unspun flax was twined, and began to cry. The
beautiful maiden put her hand on her head, took off the
flax, twined it round the stem of a slender birch, seized the
spindle, and began to spin. The spindle just swung over
the surface of the ground, grew fuller before her eyes, and
before the sun set behind the wood all the yarn was spun,
as well as that which Betty had not finished the day before.
While giving the full spool into the girl&rsquo;s hand the beautiful
maiden said: &lsquo;Reel, and grumble not&mdash;remember my
words, &ldquo;Reel, and grumble not!&rdquo;&rsquo; After these words she
vanished, as if the ground had sunk in beneath her. Betty
was content, and thought on her way, &lsquo;If she is so good
and kind, I will dance with her again if she comes again.&rsquo;
She sang again that the goats might step on merrily. But
her mother gave her no cheerful welcome. Wishing in the
course of the day to reel the yarn, she saw that the spindle
was not full, and was therefore out of humour. &lsquo;What were
you doing yesterday that you didn&rsquo;t finish your task?&rsquo; asked
her mother reprovingly. &lsquo;Pardon, mother; I danced a little
too long,&rsquo; said Betty humbly, and, showing her mother the
spindle, added: &lsquo;To-day it is more than full to make up for
it.&rsquo; Her mother said no more, but went to milk the goats,
and Betty put the spindle away. She wished to tell her
mother of her adventure, but bethought herself again, &lsquo;No,
not unless she comes again, and then I will ask her what
kind of person she is, and will tell my mother.&rsquo; So she
made up her mind and held her tongue.</p>

<p>The third morning, as usual, she drove the goats to the
birch-wood. The goats began to pasture; Betty sat under
the tree, and began to sing and spin. The sun indicated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
mid-day. Betty laid her spindle on the grass, gave each of
the goats a morsel of bread, collected strawberries, ate her
dinner, and while giving the crumbs to the birds, said:
&lsquo;My little goats, I will dance to you to-day!&rsquo; She jumped
up, folded her hands, and was just going to try whether she
could manage to dance as prettily as the beautiful maiden,
when all at once she herself stood before her. &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go
together, together!&rsquo; said she to Betty, seized her round the
waist, and at the same moment the music struck up over
their heads, and the maidens circled round with flying step.
Betty forgot her spindle and her goats, saw nothing but the
beautiful maiden, whose body bent in every direction like
a willow-wand, and thought of nothing but the delightful
music, in tune with which her feet bounded of their own
accord. They danced from mid-day till even. Then the
maiden stopped, and the music ceased. Betty looked
round; the sun was behind the wood. With tears she
clasped her hands on the top of her head, and turning in
search of the half-empty spindle, lamented about what her
mother would say to her. &lsquo;Give me your basket,&rsquo; said the
beautiful maiden. &lsquo;I will make up to you for what you
have left undone to-day.&rsquo; Betty handed her the basket,
and the maiden disappeared for a moment, and afterwards
handed Betty the basket again, saying, &lsquo;Not now; look at it
at home,&rsquo; and was gone, as if the wind had blown her away.
Betty was afraid to peep into the basket immediately, but
half-way home she couldn&rsquo;t restrain herself. The basket
was as light as if there was just nothing in it. She couldn&rsquo;t
help looking to see whether the maiden hadn&rsquo;t tricked her.
And how frightened she was when she saw that the basket
was full&mdash;of birch leaves! Then, and not till then, did she
begin to weep and lament that she had been so credulous.
In anger she threw out two handfuls of leaves, and was
going to shake the basket out; but then she bethought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
herself, &lsquo;I will use them as litter for the goats,&rsquo; and left some
leaves in the basket. She was almost afraid to go home.
The goats again could hardly recognise their shepherdess.
Her mother was waiting for her on the threshold, full of
anxiety. &lsquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, girl! what sort of spool did
you bring me home yesterday?&rsquo; were her first words. &lsquo;Why?&rsquo;
asked Betty anxiously. &lsquo;When you went out in the morning,
I went to reel; I reeled and reeled, and the spool still
remained full. One skein, two, three skeins; the spool still
full. &ldquo;What evil spirit has spun it?&rdquo; said I in a temper;
and that instant the yarn vanished from the spindle, as if it
were spirited away. Tell me what the meaning of this is!&rsquo;
Then Betty confessed, and began to tell about the beautiful
maiden. &lsquo;That was a wood-lady!&rsquo; cried her mother in
astonishment; &lsquo;about mid-day and midnight the wood-ladies
hold their dances. Lucky that you are not a boy, or you
wouldn&rsquo;t have come out of her arms alive. She would have
danced with you as long as there was breath in your body,
or have tickled you to death. But they have compassion
on girls, and often give them rich presents. It&rsquo;s a pity that
you didn&rsquo;t tell me; if I hadn&rsquo;t spoken in a temper, I might
have had a room full of yarn.&rsquo; Then Betty bethought herself
of the basket, and it occurred to her that perhaps, after
all, there might have been something under those leaves.
She took out the spindle and unspun flax from the top,
and looked once more, and, &lsquo;See, mother!&rsquo; she cried out.
Her mother looked and clapped her hands. The birch-leaves
were turned into gold! &lsquo;She ordered me: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
look now, but at home!&rdquo; but I did not obey.&rsquo; &lsquo;Lucky that
you didn&rsquo;t empty out the whole basket,&rsquo; thought her mother.</p>

<p>The next morning she went herself to look at the place
where Betty had thrown out the two handfuls of leaves, but
on the road there lay nothing but fresh birch-leaves. But
the riches that Betty had brought home were large enough.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
Her mother bought a small estate; they had many cattle.
Betty had handsome clothes, and was not obliged to pasture
goats; but whatever she had, however cheerful and happy
she was, nothing ever gave her so great delight as the dance
with the wood-lady. She often went to the birch-wood; she
was attracted there. She hoped for the good fortune of
seeing the beautiful maiden; but she never set eyes on her
more.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap07" id="chap07"></a>VII.&mdash;GEORGE WITH THE GOAT.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a king who had a daughter who never could
be induced to laugh; she was always sad. So the king
proclaimed that she should be given to anyone who could
cause her to laugh. There was also a shepherd who had a
son named George. He said: &lsquo;Daddy! I, too, will go to
see whether I can make her laugh. I want nothing from
you but the goat.&rsquo; His father said, &lsquo;Well, go.&rsquo; The goat
was of such a nature that, when her master wished, she
detained everybody, and that person was obliged to stay by
her.</p>

<p>So he took the goat and went, and met a man who had a
foot on his shoulder. George said: &lsquo;Why have you a foot
on your shoulder?&rsquo; He replied: &lsquo;If I take it off, I leap a
hundred miles.&rsquo; &lsquo;Whither are you going?&rsquo; &lsquo;I am going
in search of service, to see if anyone will take me.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,
come with us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>They went on, and again met a man who had a bandage
on his eyes. &lsquo;Why have you a bandage on your eyes?&rsquo;
He answered, &lsquo;If I remove the bandage, I see a hundred
miles.&rsquo; &lsquo;Whither are you going?&rsquo; &lsquo;I am going in search
of service, if you will take me?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll take you. Come
also with me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>They went on a bit further, and met another fellow, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
had a bottle under his arm, and, instead of a stopper, held
his thumb in it. &lsquo;Why do you hold your thumb there?&rsquo;
&lsquo;If I pull it out, I squirt a hundred miles, and besprinkle
everything that I choose. If you like, take me also into
your service; it may be to your advantage and ours too.&rsquo;
George replied: &lsquo;Well, come too!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Afterwards they came to the town where the king lived,
and bought a silken riband for the goat. They came to
an inn, and orders had already been given there beforehand,
that when such people came, they were to give them what
they liked to eat and drink&mdash;the king would pay for all. So
they tied the goat with that very riband and placed it in
the innkeeper&rsquo;s room to be taken care of, and he put it in
the side room where his daughters slept. The innkeeper
had three maiden daughters, who were not yet asleep. So
Manka said: &lsquo;Oh! if I, too, could have such a riband! I
will go and unfasten it from that goat.&rsquo; The second, Dodla,
said: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t; he&rsquo;ll find it out in the morning.&rsquo; But she
went notwithstanding. And when Manka did not return
for a long time, the third, Kate, said: &lsquo;Go, fetch her.&rsquo; So
Dodla went, and gave Manka a pat on the back. &lsquo;Come,
leave it alone!&rsquo; And now she too was unable to withdraw
herself from her. So Kate said: &lsquo;Come, don&rsquo;t unfasten it!&rsquo;
Kate went and gave Dodla a pat on the petticoat; and now
she, too, couldn&rsquo;t get away, but was obliged to stay by her.</p>

<p>In the morning George made haste and went for the
goat, and led the whole set away&mdash;Kate, Dodla, and Manka.
The innkeeper was still asleep. They went through the
village, and the judge looked out of a window and said,
&lsquo;Fie, Kate! what&rsquo;s this? what&rsquo;s this?&rsquo; He went and took
her by the hand, wishing to pull her away, but remained
also by her. After this, a cowherd drove some cows through
a narrow street, and the bull came rushing round; he stuck
fast, and George led him, too, in the procession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
Thus they afterwards came in front of the castle, and the
servants came out of doors; and when they saw such things,
they went and told the king. &lsquo;O sire, we have such a
spectacle here; we have already had all manner of masquerades,
but this has never been here yet.&rsquo; So they immediately
led the king&rsquo;s daughter to the square in front of the
castle, and she looked and laughed till the castle shook.</p>

<p>Now they asked him what sort of person he was. He
said that he was a shepherd&rsquo;s son, and was named George.
They said that it could not be done; for he was of mean
lineage, and they could not give him the damsel; but he
must accomplish something more for them. He said,
&lsquo;What?&rsquo; They replied that there was a spring yonder, a
hundred miles off; if he brought a goblet of water from it
in a minute, then he should obtain the damsel. So George
said to the man who had the foot on his shoulder: &lsquo;You
said that if you took the foot down, you could jump a
hundred miles.&rsquo; He replied: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll easily do that.&rsquo; He took
the foot down, jumped, and was there. But after this there
was only a very little time to spare, and by then he ought
to have been back. So George said to the second: &lsquo;You
said that if you removed the bandage from your eyes, you
could see a hundred miles. Peep and see what is going
on.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah, sir! Goodness gracious! he&rsquo;s fallen asleep!&rsquo;
&lsquo;That will be a bad job,&rsquo; said George; &lsquo;the time will be up.
You, third man, you said if you pulled your thumb out, you
could squirt a hundred miles; be quick and squirt thither,
that he may get up. And you, look whether he is moving,
or what.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, sir! he&rsquo;s getting up now; he&rsquo;s knocking the
dust off; he&rsquo;s drawing the water.&rsquo; He then gave a jump,
and was there exactly in time.</p>

<p>After this they said that he must perform one task more;
that yonder, in a rock, was a wild beast, a unicorn, of such
a nature that he destroyed a great many of their people; if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
he cleared him out of the world he should obtain the damsel.
So he took his people and went into the forest. They came
to a firwood. There were three wild beasts, and three lairs
had been formed by wallowing as they lay. Two did
nothing; but the third destroyed people. So they took some
stones and some pine-cones in their pockets, and climbed up
into a tree; and when the beasts lay down, they dropped a
stone down upon that one which was the unicorn. He said
to the next: &lsquo;Be quiet; don&rsquo;t butt me.&rsquo; It said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not
doing anything to you.&rsquo; Again they let a stone fall from
above upon the unicorn. &lsquo;Be quiet! you&rsquo;ve already done
it to me twice.&rsquo; &lsquo;Indeed, I&rsquo;m doing nothing to you.&rsquo; So they
attacked each other and fought together. The unicorn
wanted to pierce the second beast through; but it jumped
out of the way, and he rushed so violently after it, that he
struck his horn into a tree, and couldn&rsquo;t pull it out quickly.
So they sprang speedily down from the fir, and the other two
beasts ran away and escaped, but they cut off the head of
the third, the unicorn, took it up, and carried it to the castle.</p>

<p>Now those in the castle saw that George had again accomplished
that task. &lsquo;What, prithee, shall we do? Perhaps
we must after all give him the damsel!&rsquo; &lsquo;No, sire,&rsquo; said one
of the attendants, &lsquo;that cannot be; he is too lowborn to
obtain a king&rsquo;s daughter! On the contrary, we must clear
him out of the world.&rsquo; So the king ordered them to note
his words, what he should say. There was a hired female
servant there, and she said to him: &lsquo;George, it will be evil
for you to-day; they&rsquo;re going to clear you out of the world.&rsquo;
He answered: &lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not afraid. When I was only just
twelve years old, I killed twelve of them at one blow!&rsquo; But
this was the fact: when his mother was baking a flat-cake, a
dozen flies settled upon her, and he killed them all at a single
blow.</p>

<p>When they heard this, they said: &lsquo;Nothing else will do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
but we must shoot him.&rsquo; So they drew up the soldiers, and
said they would hold a review in his honour, for they would
celebrate the wedding in the square before the castle. Then
they conducted him thither, and the soldiers were already
going to let fly at him. But George said to the man who
held his thumb in the bottle in place of a stopper: &lsquo;You
said, if you pulled your thumb out, you could besprinkle
everything. Pull it out&mdash;quick!&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, sir, I&rsquo;ll easily perform
that.&rsquo; So he pulled out his thumb and gave them all
such a sprinkling, that they were all blind, and not one
could see.</p>

<p>So, when they perceived that nothing else was to be done,
they told him to go, for they would give him the damsel.
Then they gave him a handsome royal robe, and the wedding
took place. I, too, was at the wedding; they had music
there, sang, ate, and drank; there was meat, there were
cheesecakes, and baskets full of everything, and buckets full
of strong waters. To-day I went, yesterday I came; I
found an egg among the tree-stumps; I knocked it against
somebody&rsquo;s head, and gave him a bald place, and he&rsquo;s got
it still.</p>

<hr class="rule" />

<p>This story is related to Grimm&rsquo;s tale of the &lsquo;Golden
Goose,&rsquo; but it is much more rationally constructed, and
much more interesting. The man who jumps one hundred
miles appears to be the rainbow, the man with bandaged
eyes the lightning, and the man with the bottle the cloud.
The interpretation will be very similar to that of <a href="#chap01">No. 1</a>, but
the allegory is by no means so clear or so well constructed.
As to the nonsense at the end, it is a specimen of the
manner in which the narrators of stories frequently finish
them in all Slavonic languages.</p>

<h3><a name="part01b" id="part01b"></a><i>MORAVIAN STORIES.</i></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>ORAVIA is so named from the river Morava (in
German the river March), of which, and its affluents,
it is the basin. It falls into the Danube a little above Presburg.
In very early times Moravia appears to have been more
civilized and powerful than Bohemia; but later, Bohemia
became a considerable kingdom, and Moravia a dependency
of, and eventually a margravate under the Bohemian crown.</p>

<p>The Moravian stories differ but little in character from
those of Bohemia. The country, unlike Bohemia, abounds
in dialects, although the literary language is the Bohemian.
On the east the Moravian melts into the Silesian, or &lsquo;Water-Polish.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a href="#chap08">No. 8</a>, &lsquo;Godmother Death,&rsquo; is an interesting variant of
the Teutonic &lsquo;Godfather Death,&rsquo; which is given by Grimm.
The reason why Death is represented as a Godmother,
rather than a Godfather, in the Moravian story, is, that
Death (<i>Smrt</i>) is feminine in all Slavonic dialects. The
story constructed on this basis is more graceful and fuller of
incident than the Teutonic tale, in which Death is masculine.</p>

<p><a href="#chap09">No. 9</a> is another story falling under the head of &lsquo;Natural
Science in Allegory,&rsquo; which is clearer and simpler in construction
and interpretation than any variant of it that I am
acquainted with.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap08" id="chap08"></a>VIII.&mdash;GODMOTHER DEATH.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a man, very poor in this world&rsquo;s goods, whose
wife presented him with a baby boy. No one was willing
to stand sponsor, because he was so very poor. The father
said to himself: &lsquo;Dear Lord, I am so poor that no one is
willing to be at my service in this matter; I&rsquo;ll take the
baby, I&rsquo;ll go, and I&rsquo;ll ask the first person I meet to act as
sponsor, and if I don&rsquo;t meet anybody, perhaps the sexton will
help me.&rsquo; He went and met Death, but didn&rsquo;t know what
manner of person she was; she was a handsome woman,
like any other woman. He asked her to be godmother.
She didn&rsquo;t make any excuse, and immediately saluted him
as parent of her godchild, took the baby in her arms, and
carried him to church. The little lad was properly christened.
When they came out of church, the child&rsquo;s father took the
godmother to an inn, and wanted to give her a little treat as
godmother. But she said to him, &lsquo;Gossip,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> leave this alone,
and come with me to my abode.&rsquo; She took him with her
to her apartment, which was very handsomely furnished.
Afterwards she conducted him into great vaults, and through
these vaults they went right into the under-world in the dark.
There tapers were burning of three sizes&mdash;small, large, and
middle-sized; and those which were not yet alight were very
large. The godmother said to the godchild&rsquo;s father: &lsquo;Look,
Gossip, here I have the duration of everybody&rsquo;s life.&rsquo; The
child&rsquo;s father gazed thereat, found there a tiny taper close
to the very ground, and asked her: &lsquo;But, Gossip, I pray
you, whose is this little taper close to the ground?&rsquo; She
said to him: &lsquo;That is yours! When any taper whatsoever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
burns down, I must go for that man.&rsquo; He said to her:
&lsquo;Gossip, I pray you, give me somewhat additional.&rsquo; She
said to him: &lsquo;Gossip, I cannot do that!&rsquo; Afterwards she
went and lighted a large new taper for the baby boy whom
they had had christened. Meanwhile, while the godmother
was not looking, the child&rsquo;s father took for himself a large
new taper, lit it, and placed it where his tiny taper was
burning down.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_1_1">[1]</a></span>
The Slavonians are rich in terms, both masculine and feminine,
expressing the various relationships between godparents and godchildren
and their parents. We have only one form, &lsquo;gossip,&rsquo; which thus has to
do duty for both the godmother and the father of the godchild.</p>
</div>

<p>The godmother looked round at him and said: &lsquo;Gossip,
you ought not to have done that to me; but if you have given
yourself additional lifetime, you have done so and possess
it. Let us go hence, and we&rsquo;ll go to your wife.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She took a present, and went with the child&rsquo;s father and
the child to the mother. She arrived, and placed the boy on
his mother&rsquo;s bed, and asked her how she was, and whether she
had any pain anywhere. The mother confided her griefs to
her, and the father sent for some beer, and wanted to entertain
her in his cottage, as godmother, in order to gratify her and
show his gratitude. They drank and feasted together. Afterwards
the godmother said to her godchild&rsquo;s father: &lsquo;Gossip,
you are so poor that no one but myself would be at your
service in this matter; but never mind, you shall bear me in
memory! I will go to the houses of various respectable
people and make them ill, and you shall physic and cure
them. I will tell you all the remedies. I possess them all,
and everybody will be glad to recompense you well, only
observe this: When I stand at anyone&rsquo;s feet, you can be of
assistance to every such person; but if I stand at anybody&rsquo;s
head, don&rsquo;t attempt to aid him.&rsquo; It came to pass. The
child&rsquo;s father went from patient to patient, where the godmother
caused illness, and benefited every one. All at once
he became a distinguished physician. A prince was dying&mdash;nay,
he had breathed his last&mdash;nevertheless, they sent for the
physician. He came, he began to anoint him with salves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
and give him his powders, and did him good. When he had
restored him to health, they paid him well, without asking
how much they were indebted. Again, a count was dying.
They sent for the physician again. The physician came.
Death was standing behind the bed at his head. The physician
cried: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a bad case, but we&rsquo;ll have a try.&rsquo; He
summoned the servants, and ordered them to turn the bed
round with the patient&rsquo;s feet towards Death, and began to
anoint him with salves and administer powders into his
mouth, and did him good. The count paid him in return
as much as he could carry away, without ever asking how
much he was indebted; he was only too glad that he had
restored him to health. When Death met the physician, she
said to him: &lsquo;Gossip, if this occurs to you again, don&rsquo;t play
me that trick any more. True, you have done him good,
but only for a while; I must, none the less, take him off
whither he is due.&rsquo; The child&rsquo;s father went on in this way
for some years; he was now very old. But at last he was
wearied out, and asked Death herself to take him. Death
was unable to take him, because he had given himself
a long additional taper; she was obliged to wait till it
burned out. One day he drove to a certain patient to
restore him to health, and did so. Afterwards Death revealed
herself to him, and rode with him in his carriage.
She began to tickle and play with him, and tap him with a
green twig under the throat; he threw himself into her lap,
and went off into the last sleep. Death laid him in the
carriage, and took herself off. They found the physician
lying dead in his carriage, and conveyed him home. The
whole town and all the villages lamented: &lsquo;That physician
is much to be regretted. What a good doctor he was! He
was of great assistance; there will never be his like again!&rsquo;
His son remained after him, but had not the same skill.</p>

<p>The son went one day into church, and his godmother met
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
him. She asked him: &lsquo;My dear son, how are you?&rsquo; He said to
her: &lsquo;Not all alike; so long as I have what my dad saved up
for me, it is well with me, but after that the Lord God knows
how it will be with me.&rsquo; His godmother said: &lsquo;Well, my
son, fear nought. I am your christening mamma; I helped
your father to what he had, and will give you, too, a livelihood.
You shall go to a physician as a pupil, and you shall
be more skilful than he, only behave nicely.&rsquo; After this she
anointed him with salve over the ears, and conducted him
to a physician. The physician didn&rsquo;t know what manner of
lady it was, and what sort of son she brought him for instruction.
The lady enjoined her son to behave nicely, and requested
the physician to instruct him well, and bring him
into a good position. Then she took leave of him and
departed. The physician and the lad went together to gather
herbs, and each herb cried out to the pupil what remedial
virtue it had, and the pupil gathered it. The physician also
gathered herbs, but knew not, with regard to any herb,
what remedial virtue it possessed. The pupil&rsquo;s herbs were
beneficial in every disease. The physician said to the pupil:
&lsquo;You are cleverer than I, for I diagnose no one that comes to
me; but you know herbs counter to every disease. Do you
know what? Let us join partnership. I will give my doctor&rsquo;s
diploma up to you, and will be your assistant, and am willing
to be with you till death.&rsquo; The lad was successful in doctoring
and curing till his taper burned out in limbo.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap09" id="chap09"></a>IX.&mdash;THE FOUR BROTHERS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was, once upon a time, a huntsman who had four
sons, and these sons wanted to go to gain experience in the
world. When they were all over sixteen years old, they said
to their father: &lsquo;We are going into the world, father; we
pray you give us money for our journey.&rsquo; The father gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
them 100 florins and a horse apiece. They mounted their
horses and rode to the mountains. On a mountain were
four roads, and between them stood a beech-tree. At this
beech-tree they halted, and the eldest said to the rest,
&lsquo;Brothers, let us separate here, and go each by a different
road to seek his fortune in the world. Let us each stick
his knife into this beech-tree, and in a year and a day let us
all meet together here. These knives will be tokens for us;
if any one of the knives is rusty, the one of us to whom it
belongs will be dead; and he whose knife is free from rust
will be alive and well.&rsquo; They separated, and went each his
way, and when they came to suitable places they each
learned a handicraft. The eldest learned to be a cobbler,
the second to be a thief, the third to be an astrologer, and
the fourth to be a huntsman. When the year and day
arrived, they started on their return. The eldest came first
to the beech-tree, pulled out his own knife and looked at
the other knives. Seeing that they were all free from rust,
he rejoiced, and said, &lsquo;Praise be to God! we are all alive
and well.&rsquo; He went home. When he came to his father,
his father asked him, &lsquo;What manner of handicraft have you
learnt?&rsquo; The son replied, &lsquo;Daddy, it&rsquo;s no use telling you
stories; I&rsquo;m a cobbler.&rsquo; The father said, &lsquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve
learned a nice gainful handicraft.&rsquo; The son answered, &lsquo;But,
daddy, I&rsquo;m not a cobbler like other cobblers, but I&rsquo;m this
kind of cobbler: if anything is worn out, I only say, &ldquo;Let
it be mended up,&rdquo; and it is so at once.&rsquo; The father had a
coat worn out at the elbows, and told him to cobble it up.
The son gave the command, &lsquo;Let it be mended up,&rsquo; and in
a moment the coat was mended up as if it were brand new,
nor was it possible to know that it had been mended at all.
Upon this the father said nothing more. The next day the
second son came to the beech. He pulled out his own
knife, and looked at the remaining two; the third was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
already gone. Seeing that they were both free from rust,
he rejoiced, and said, &lsquo;Praise be to God! we are all alive
and well; our eldest brother is at home already.&rsquo; He also
went home. When he came to his father, his father asked
him, &lsquo;What manner of handicraft have you learned?&rsquo; The
son replied, &lsquo;Dear daddy, it&rsquo;s no use telling stories to you;
I&rsquo;m a thief.&rsquo; The father said, &lsquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve learned a nice
gainful trade! Shame on you!&rsquo; The son said to him,
&lsquo;But, daddy, I&rsquo;m not a thief like a thief, but I&rsquo;m such a
thief that, if I think of anything, be it where it may, I have
it with me at once.&rsquo; Just then a hare came running on the
hillside; it could be seen through the window; the father
told him to fetch the hare. The son immediately said, &lsquo;Let
yon hare be here,&rsquo; and it was with them at once. After this
the father said no more. The third day the third son came
to the beech, pulled out his own knife and looked at the
other knife, two not being there. Seeing that it was clear
of rust, he said, &lsquo;Praise be to God! we are all alive and
well; my two elder brothers are at home already.&rsquo; He also
went home. When he came to his father, his father asked
him what manner of handicraft he had learned. The son
replied, &lsquo;Dear daddy, it&rsquo;s no use to tell you stories; I&rsquo;m
an astrologer.&rsquo; His father said to him that it was a nice
pretty handicraft. The son answered, &lsquo;But, daddy, I am
this kind of astrologer: if I look at the sky, I see at once
where anything is in the whole earth.&rsquo; On the fourth day
the youngest son came to the beech and pulled out his
knife, the other three being there no longer. He was glad,
and said, &lsquo;My brothers are already all at home.&rsquo; He also
went home. When he came to his father, the father asked
him what manner of handicraft he had learned. The son
answered that he was a huntsman. The father said, &lsquo;Anyhow,
you have not despised my craft; for that you&rsquo;re a good
lad.&rsquo; The son said, &lsquo;But, dear daddy, I&rsquo;m not such a huntsman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
as you are, but one of this kind; if there is an unusually
fine head of game, I say, &ldquo;Let it be shot,&rdquo; and immediately
shot it is.&rsquo; There was a hare darting along the
hillside; it was visible through the window. The father
said, &lsquo;Shoot it!&rsquo; The youngest son spoke the word, and
the hare lay dead. The father said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see whether it
is lying dead.&rsquo; The astrologer looked at the sky, and said,
&lsquo;Yes, daddy, it&rsquo;s lying there behind the bushes.&rsquo; The father
said, &lsquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s lying there, but how are we to get it?&rsquo; The
brother who was a thief said, &lsquo;Let it be here,&rsquo; and immediately
there it was. But it had come through thorny bushes,
and was all torn. The father said, &lsquo;The whole skin is torn;
who&rsquo;ll buy it of us?&rsquo; The brother who was a cobbler said,
&lsquo;Let it be mended up,&rsquo; and immediately mended up it was.
The father said, &lsquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll all four maintain yourselves
by your handicrafts.&rsquo;</p>

<p>They lived for some time at home with their father, and
maintained themselves well. Then a king lost the princess,
his daughter, and made proclamation that whoever should
find her, to that person he would give his daughter and the
kingdom as well. The brothers said to one another, &lsquo;Let
us go thither.&rsquo; The father didn&rsquo;t give them leave to go, but
go they did, and gave out that they were the people who
would find the lost princess. The king immediately sent a
carriage for them. When they came to the king, they said
that they understood he had made proclamation that his
daughter was lost, and that he would give her and the kingdom
as well to whoever should find her. The king said
that this was very truth, and immediately asked them to tell
him where his daughter was. The astrologer replied that
he could not tell him just then, but when evening came he
would perceive in the sky where she was. About eight or
nine o&rsquo;clock they went out and gazed at the sky. The
astrologer said that she had been taken captive by a dragon;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
that the dragon had seized her as she was out walking, and
was keeping her on an island beyond the Red Sea; that she
was obliged to fondle him for two hours every day, and that
the dragon then had his head placed on her lap. When
day came, they assembled and drove in the carriage to the
Red Sea. Then they got into a boat and rowed to the
island where the princess was. When they arrived at the
island, the princess was out walking, and the dragon wasn&rsquo;t
at home; but the princess made signs to them that they
were in evil case, for the dragon was just flying home. The
thief-brother called out with speed, &lsquo;Let the princess be
here!&rsquo; She was with them in the boat at once, but cried
out that they were in evil case, and would all perish. They
rowed speedily away in the boat, but the dragon, full of
wrath, roared and growled and rose in the air above them.
The astrologer said to the huntsman, &lsquo;Brother, shoot him.&rsquo;
The huntsman-brother said, &lsquo;Let him be shot.&rsquo; The dragon
was shot, but fell on the boat and broke a hole in it, so that
the water came in. They threw the dragon into the sea,
and the huntsman-brother gave the word to the cobbler-brother,
&lsquo;Mend the leak.&rsquo; The cobbler-brother mended
the leak, so that not a drop of water came into the boat to
them. Thus they arrived safely with the princess at the
sea-shore, landed on the beach, took their seats in the carriage
with the princess, and drove off. But as they drove
along in the carriage, they disputed to which of them the
princess and the kingdom belonged. The astrologer said,
&lsquo;The princess is mine. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for me, we
shouldn&rsquo;t have known where the princess was.&rsquo; The thief
said, &lsquo;The princess is mine. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for me, we
shouldn&rsquo;t have got the princess into the boat.&rsquo; The huntsman
said that the princess was his; if it hadn&rsquo;t been for
him, they wouldn&rsquo;t have shot the dragon. The cobbler
shouted that the princess was his; if it hadn&rsquo;t been for him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
they would all have been drowned and have perished.
When they came to the palace to the king, they asked him
to decide to whom the princess belonged. The king said,
&lsquo;Dear brothers, I will judge you righteously. It is true
that you have all deserved her, but you cannot all obtain
her. According to my promise, the astrologer-brother must
obtain her, for I made proclamation that whoever should
<em>find</em> the lost princess should obtain her and the kingdom
with her; the astrologer found her, and told us where she
was. But, that none of you may be unfairly dealt with,
each shall receive a district of his own, and ye shall each be
kings in your own districts.&rsquo; They were all content. The
astrologer, as soon as the wedding was over, sent home for
his father. The father came, and was delighted that his
sons had become monarchs each in his district. In the
spring he lived with the cobbler, in the summer with the
thief, in the autumn with the huntsman, and in winter
with the astrologer, and enjoyed himself everywhere till
death.</p>

<hr class="rule" />

<p>I think that this story is connected with the Ceres and
Proserpine cycle, only the daughter is lost by a father
instead of a mother. It will be seen, also, that at the conclusion
of the story the order of the brothers is not the same
as in the story itself. And I think the error is in the story,
and that the astrologer ought to have been the youngest
brother instead of the huntsman. The brothers are the
four seasons of the year, which in ancient times began with
spring, the cobbler, who mends up all things, and makes
them new again; next comes summer, the thief, who gathers
the products of the earth; third comes autumn, the huntsman,
when the wild animals that have increased and multiplied
during the year are destroyed and reduced within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
limits; last comes winter, the astrologer, when ploughing,
sowing, and other agricultural operations that govern the
whole year go on by calculation. Thus the princess herself,
the earth or its fertility, is assigned to the representative of
winter, while the other seasons are lords each in his own
district.</p>

<p>This Moravian tale will bear an advantageous comparison
with Grimm&rsquo;s tale of the &lsquo;Four Accomplished Brothers,&rsquo;
in which neither of the brothers is allowed to obtain the
princess.</p>

<h3><a name="part01c" id="part01c"></a><i>HUNGARIAN-SLOVENISH STORIES.</i></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Slovenes or Slovaks of North Hungary speak a
great number of dialects, their literary language being,
however, the Bohemian. They seem to be the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of a
much larger nation or assemblage of nations, which was forced
out of the plains of Pannonia into the mountains by the invasion
of the Magyar or Hungarian horsemen, who, according
to the Russian chronicler Nestor, marched past Kief in
<small>A.D.</small> 898, on their way to establish themselves in their present
abode.</p>

<p>Their stories are not very dissimilar to the Bohemian
tales, although they do not resemble them so closely as the
Moravian stories do. <a href="#chap10">No. 10</a> is one of the tales that especially
attracted my attention, and caused me to entertain the
idea of translating a considerable selection out of the
hundred given by Erben. <a href="#chap11">No. 11</a> contains incidents which
occur again in the White Russian story (<a href="#chap22">No. 22</a>), and in
the great Russian tale of &lsquo;Ivan Popyalof,&rsquo; given by Ralston,
though in other respects the stories are very different. <a href="#chap12">No. 12</a>
is a superior variant of the German &lsquo;Rumpelstilskin&rsquo; given

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap10" id="chap10"></a>X.&mdash;THE THREE LEMONS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once upon a time an old king who had an only
son. This son he one day summoned before him, and
spoke to him thus: &lsquo;My son, you see that my head has
become white; ere long I shall close my eyes, and I do not
yet know in what condition I shall leave you. Take a wife,
my son! Let me bless you in good time, before I close my
eyes.&rsquo; The son made no reply, but became lost in thought;
he would gladly with all his heart have fulfilled his father&rsquo;s
wish, but there was no damsel in whom his heart could take
delight.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, when he was sitting in the garden, and
just considering what to do, all of a sudden an old woman
appeared before him&mdash;where she came, there she came.
&lsquo;Go to the glass hill, pluck the three lemons, and you will
have a wife in whom your heart will take delight,&rsquo; said she,
and as she had appeared so she disappeared. Like a bright
flash did these words dart through the prince&rsquo;s soul. At
that moment he determined, come what might, to seek the
glass hill and pluck the three lemons. He made known his
determination to his father, and his father gave him for the
journey a horse, arms and armour, and his fatherly blessing.</p>

<p>Through forest-covered mountains, through desert plains,
went our prince on his pilgrimage, for a very, very great
distance; but there was nothing to be seen, nothing to be
heard of the glass hill and the three lemons. Once, quite
wearied out with his long journey, he threw himself down
under the cool shade of a broad lime-tree. As he threw
himself down, his father&rsquo;s sword, which he wore at his side,
clanged against the ground, and a dozen ravens began
croaking at the top of the tree. Frightened by the clang of
the sword, they rose on their wings, and flew into the air
above the lofty tree. &lsquo;Hem! till now I haven&rsquo;t seen a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
living creature for a long while,&rsquo; said the prince to himself,
springing from the ground. &lsquo;I will go in the direction in
which the ravens have flown; maybe some hope will disclose
itself to me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He went on&mdash;he went on anew for three whole days and
three nights, till at last a lofty castle displayed itself to him
at a distance. &lsquo;Praise be to God! I shall now at any
rate come to human beings,&rsquo; cried he, and proceeded
further.</p>

<p>The castle was of pure lead; round it flew the twelve
ravens, and in front of it stood an old woman&mdash;it was
Jezibaba<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;leaning on a long leaden staff. &lsquo;Ah, my son!
whither have you come? Here there is neither bird nor
insect to be seen, much less a human being,&rsquo; said Jezibaba
to the prince. &lsquo;Flee, if life is dear to you; for, if my son
comes, he will devour you.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah! not so, old mother, not
so!&rsquo; entreated the prince. &lsquo;I have come to you for counsel
as to whether you cannot let me have some information
about the glass hill and the three lemons.&rsquo; &lsquo;I have never
heard of the glass hill; but stay! when my son comes
home, maybe he will be able to let you have the information.
But I will now conceal you somewhat; you will hide yourself
under the besom, and wait there concealed till I call
you.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_2_2">[2]</a></span>
Jezibaba is said to represent winter.</p>
</div>

<p>The mountains echoed, the castle quaked, and Jezibaba
whispered to the prince that her son was coming. &lsquo;Foh!
foh! there is a smell of human flesh; I am going to eat
it!&rsquo; shouted Jezibaba&rsquo;s son, while still in the doorway, and
thumped on the ground with a huge leaden club, so that the
whole castle quaked. &lsquo;Ah, not so, my son, not so!&rsquo; said
Jezibaba, soothing him. &lsquo;There has come a handsome
youth who wants to consult you about something.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,
if he wants to consult me, let him come here.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
indeed, my son, he shall come, but only on condition that
you promise to do nothing to him.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll do nothing
to him, only let him come.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The prince was trembling like an aspen under the besom,
for he saw before him through the twigs an ogre, up to
whose knees he didn&rsquo;t reach. Happily his life was safeguarded,
when Jezibaba bade him come out from under the
besom. &lsquo;Well, you beetle, why are you afraid?&rsquo; shouted
the giant. &lsquo;Whence are you? What do you want?&rsquo;
&lsquo;What do I want?&rsquo; replied the prince. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve long been
wandering in these mountains, and can&rsquo;t find that which I
am seeking. Now I&rsquo;ve come to ask you whether you can&rsquo;t
give me information about the glass hill and the three
lemons.&rsquo; Jezibaba&rsquo;s son wrinkled his brow, but, after a
while, said in a somewhat gentler voice: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing
to be seen here of the glass hill; but go to my brother in
the silver castle, maybe he&rsquo;ll be able to tell you something.
But stay, I won&rsquo;t let you go away hungry. Mother, here
with the dumplings!&rsquo; Old Jezibaba set a large dish upon
the table, and her gigantic son sat down to it. &lsquo;Come and
eat!&rsquo; shouted he to the prince. The prince took the first
dumpling and began to eat, but two of his teeth broke, for
they were dumplings of lead. &lsquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you eat?
maybe you don&rsquo;t like them?&rsquo; inquired Jezibaba&rsquo;s son.
&lsquo;Yes, they are good; but I don&rsquo;t want any just now.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t want any just now, pocket some, and go
your way.&rsquo; The good prince&mdash;would he, nould he&mdash;was
obliged to put some of the leaden dumplings into his
pocket. He then took leave and proceeded further.</p>

<p>On he went and on he went for three whole days and three
nights, and the further he went, the deeper he wandered into a
thickly wooded and gloomy range of mountains. Before him it
was desolate, behind him it was desolate; there wasn&rsquo;t a single
living creature to be seen. All wearied from his long journey,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
he threw himself on the ground. The clang of his silver-mounted
sword spread far and wide. Above him four and
twenty ravens, frightened by the clash of his sword, began to
croak, and, rising on their wings, flew into the air. &lsquo;A good
sign!&rsquo; cried the prince. &lsquo;I will go in the direction in which
the birds have flown.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And on he went in that direction, on he went as fast as
his feet could carry him, till all at once a lofty castle displayed
itself to him! He was still far from the castle, and
already its walls were glistening in his eyes, for the castle
was of pure silver. In front of the castle stood an old
woman bent with age, leaning on a long silver staff, and this
was Jezibaba. &lsquo;Ah, my son! How is it that you have
come here? Here there is neither bird nor insect, much
less a human being!&rsquo; cried Jezibaba to the prince; &lsquo;if life is
dear to you, flee away, for if my son comes, he will devour
you!&rsquo; &lsquo;Nay, old mother, he will hardly eat me. I bring
him a greeting from his brother in the leaden castle.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Well, if you bring a greeting from the leaden castle, then
come into the parlour, my son, and tell me what you are
seeking.&rsquo; &lsquo;What I am seeking, old mother? For ever so
long a time I&rsquo;ve been seeking the glass hill and the three
lemons, and cannot find them; now I&rsquo;ve come to inquire
whether you can&rsquo;t give me information about them.&rsquo; &lsquo;I
know nothing about the glass hill; but stay! when my son
comes, maybe he will be able to give you the information.
Hide yourself under the bed, and don&rsquo;t make yourself known
unless I call you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The mountains echoed with a mighty voice, the castle
quaked, and the prince knew that Jezibaba&rsquo;s son was coming
home. &lsquo;Foh! foh! there&rsquo;s a smell of human flesh; I&rsquo;m
going to eat it!&rsquo; roared a horrible ogre already in the doorway,
and thumped upon the ground with a silver club, so
that the whole castle quaked. &lsquo;Ah! not so, my son, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
so; but a handsome youth has come and has brought you a
greeting from your brother in the leaden castle.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, if
he&rsquo;s been at my brother&rsquo;s, and if he has done nothing to him,
let him have no fear of me either; let him come out.&rsquo; The
prince sprang out from under the bed, and went up to him,
looking beside him as if he had placed himself under a very
tall pine. &lsquo;Well, beetle, have you been at my brother&rsquo;s?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Indeed, I have; and here I&rsquo;ve still the dumplings, which
he gave me for the journey.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, I believe you; now
tell me what it is you want.&rsquo; &lsquo;What I want? I am come
to ask you whether you can&rsquo;t give me information about the
glass hill or the three lemons.&rsquo; &lsquo;Hem! I&rsquo;ve heard formerly
about it, but I don&rsquo;t know how to direct you. Meanwhile,
do you know what? Go to my brother in the golden castle,
he will direct you. But stay, I won&rsquo;t let you go away
hungry. Mother, here with the dumplings!&rsquo; Jezibaba
brought the dumplings on a large silver dish, and set them on
the table. &lsquo;Eat!&rsquo; shouted her son. The prince, seeing
that they were silver dumplings, said that he didn&rsquo;t want to
eat just then, but would take some for his journey, if he
would give him them. &lsquo;Take as many as you like, and
greet my brother and aunt.&rsquo; The prince took the dumplings,
thanked him courteously, and proceeded further.</p>

<p>Three days had already passed since he quitted the silver
castle, wandering continuously through densely wooded
mountains, not knowing which way to go, whether to the
right hand or to the left. All wearied out, he threw himself
down under a wide-spreading beech, to take a little breath.
His silver-mounted sword clanged on the ground, and the
sound spread far and wide. &lsquo;Krr, krr, krr!&rsquo; croaked a flock
of ravens over the traveller, scared by the clash of his sword,
and flew into the air. &lsquo;Praise be to God! the golden castle
won&rsquo;t be far off now,&rsquo; cried the prince, and proceeded, encouraged,
onwards in the direction in which the ravens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
showed him the road. Scarcely had he come out of the
valley on to a small hill, when he saw a beautiful and wide
meadow, and in the midst of the meadow stood a golden
castle, just as if he were gazing at the sun; and before the
gate of the castle stood an old bent Jezibaba, leaning on a
golden staff. &lsquo;Ah! my son! what do you seek for here?&rsquo;
cried she to the prince. &lsquo;Here there is neither bird nor
insect to be seen, much less a human being! If your life is
dear to you, flee, for if my son comes, he will devour you!&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay, old mother, he&rsquo;ll hardly eat me,&rsquo; replied he. &lsquo;I
bring him a greeting from his brother in the silver castle.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Well, if you bring him a greeting from the silver castle,
come into the parlour and tell me what has brought you to
us.&rsquo; &lsquo;What has brought me to you, old mother? I have
long been wandering in this mountain range, and haven&rsquo;t
been able to find out where are the glass hill and the three
lemons. I was directed to you, because haply you might
be able to give me information about it.&rsquo; &lsquo;Where is the
glass hill? I cannot tell you that; but stay! when my son
comes, he will counsel you which way you must go, and
what you must do. Hide yourself under the table, and stay
there till I call you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The mountains echoed, the castle quaked, and Jezibaba&rsquo;s
son stepped into the parlour. &lsquo;Foh! foh! there&rsquo;s a smell
of human flesh; I&rsquo;m going to eat it!&rsquo; shouted he, while
still in the doorway, and thumped with a golden club upon
the ground, so that the whole castle quaked. &lsquo;Gently, my
son, gently!&rsquo; said Jezibaba, soothing him; &lsquo;there is a handsome
youth come, who brings you a greeting from your
brother in the silver castle. If you will do nothing to him,
I will call him at once.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, if my brother has done
nothing to him, neither will I do anything to him.&rsquo; The
prince came out from under the table and placed himself
beside him, looking, in comparison, as if he had placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
himself beside a lofty tower, and showed him the silver
dumplings in token that he had really been at the silver
castle. &lsquo;Well, tell me, you beetle, what you want!&rsquo; shouted
the monstrous ogre; &lsquo;if I can counsel you, counsel you I
will; don&rsquo;t fear!&rsquo; Then the prince explained to him the
aim of his long journey, and begged him to advise him
which way to go to the glass hill, and what he must do to
obtain the three lemons. &lsquo;Do you see that black knoll that
looms yonder?&rsquo; said he, pointing with his golden club; &lsquo;that
is the glass hill; on the top of the hill stands a tree, and on
the tree hang three lemons, whose scent spreads seven miles
round. You will go up the glass hill, kneel under the tree,
and hold up your hands; if the lemons are destined for you,
they will fall off into your hands of themselves; but, if they
are not destined for you, you will not pluck them, whatever
you do. When you are on your return, and are hungry or
thirsty, cut one of the lemons into halves, and you will eat
and drink your fill. And now go, and God be with you!
But stay, I won&rsquo;t let you go hungry. Mother, here with
the dumplings!&rsquo; Jezibaba set a large golden dish on the
table. &lsquo;Eat!&rsquo; said her son to the prince, &lsquo;or, if you don&rsquo;t
want to do so now, put some into your pocket; you will eat
them on the road.&rsquo; The prince had no desire to eat, but
put some into his pocket, saying that he would eat them on
the road. He then thanked him courteously for his hospitality
and counsel, and proceeded further.</p>

<p>Swiftly he paced from hill into dale, from dale on to a
fresh hill, and never stopped till he was beneath the glass
hill itself. There he stopped, as if turned to a stone. The
hill was high and smooth; there wasn&rsquo;t a single crack in it.
On the top spread the branches of a wondrous tree, and on
the tree swung three lemons, whose scent was so powerful
that the prince almost fainted. &lsquo;God help me! Now, as it
shall be, so it will be. Now that I&rsquo;m once here, I will at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
any rate make the attempt,&rsquo; thought he to himself, and
began to climb up the smooth glass; but scarcely had he
ascended a few fathoms when his foot slipped, and he himself,
pop! down the hill, so that he didn&rsquo;t know where he
was, or what he was, till he found himself on the ground at
the bottom. Wearied out, he began to throw away the
dumplings, thinking that their weight was a hindrance to
him. He threw away the first, and lo! the dumpling fixed
itself on the glass hill. He threw a second and a third, and
saw before him three steps, on which he could stand with
safety. The prince was overjoyed. He kept throwing the
dumplings before him, and in every case steps formed themselves
from them for him. First he threw the leaden ones,
then the silver, and then the golden ones. By the steps
thus constructed he ascended higher and higher till he
happily attained the topmost ridge of the glass hill. Here
he knelt down under the tree and held up his hands. And
lo! the three beautiful lemons flew down of themselves into
the palms of his hands. The tree disappeared, the glass
hill crashed and vanished, and when the prince came to
himself, there was no tree, no hill, but a wide plain lay
extended before him.</p>

<p>He commenced his return homeward with delight. He
neither ate nor drank, nor saw nor heard, for very joy.
But when the third day came, a vacuum began to make
itself felt in his stomach. He was so hungry that he would
gladly have then and there betaken himself to the leaden
dumplings if his pocket hadn&rsquo;t been empty. His pocket
was empty, and all around was just as bare as the palm of
his hand. Then he took a lemon out of his pocket and cut
it into halves; and what came to pass? Out of the lemon
sprang a beautiful damsel, who made a reverence before
him, and cried out: &lsquo;Have you made ready for me to eat?
Have you made ready for me to drink? Have you made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
pretty dresses ready for me?&rsquo; &lsquo;I have nothing, beautiful
creature, for you to eat, nothing for you to drink, nothing
for you to put on,&rsquo; said the prince, in a sorrowful voice, and
the beautiful damsel clapped her white hands thrice before
him, made a reverence and vanished.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aha! now I know what sort of lemons these are,&rsquo; said
the prince; &lsquo;stay! I won&rsquo;t cut them up so lightly.&rsquo; From
the cut one he ate and drank to his satisfaction, and thus
refreshed, proceeded onwards.</p>

<p>But on the third day a hunger three times worse than
the preceding, assailed him. &lsquo;God help me!&rsquo; said he;
&lsquo;I have still one remaining over. I&rsquo;ll cut it up.&rsquo; He then
took out the second lemon, cut it in halves, and lo! a
damsel still more beautiful than the preceding one placed
herself before him. &lsquo;Have you made ready for me to eat?
Have you made ready for me to drink? Have you made
pretty dresses ready for me?&rsquo; &lsquo;I have not, dear soul! I
have not!&rsquo; and the beautiful damsel clapped her hands thrice
before him, made a reverence, and vanished.</p>

<p>Now he had only one lemon remaining; he took it in his
hand and said: &lsquo;I will not cut you open save in my father&rsquo;s
house,&rsquo; and therewith proceeded onwards. On the third
day he saw, after long absence, his native town. He didn&rsquo;t
know himself how he got there, when he found himself at once
in his father&rsquo;s castle. Tears of joy bedewed his old father&rsquo;s
cheeks: &lsquo;Welcome, my son! welcome a hundred times!&rsquo;
he cried, and fell upon his neck. The prince related how
it had gone with him on his journey, and the members of
the household how anxiously they had waited for him.</p>

<p>On the next day a grand entertainment was prepared;
lords and ladies were invited from all quarters; and beautiful
dresses, embroidered with gold and studded with pearls
were got ready. The lords and ladies assembled, took their
seats at the tables, and waited expectantly to see what would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
happen. Then the prince took out the last lemon, cut it
in halves, and out of the lemon sprang a lady thrice as
beautiful as had been the preceding ones. &lsquo;Have you
made ready for me to eat? Have you made ready for me
to drink? Have you got pretty dresses ready for me?&rsquo; &lsquo;I
have, my dear soul, got everything ready for you,&rsquo; answered
the prince, and presented the handsome dresses to her. The
beautiful damsel put on the beautiful clothes, and all rejoiced
at her extraordinary beauty. Ere long the betrothal
took place, and after the betrothal a magnificent wedding.</p>

<p>Now was fulfilled the old king&rsquo;s wish; he blessed his son,
resigned the kingdom into his hands, and ere long died.</p>

<p>The first thing that occurred to the new king after his
father&rsquo;s death was a war, which a neighbouring king excited
against him. Now he was constrained for the first time to
part from his hard-earned wife. Lest, therefore, anything
should happen to her in his absence, he caused a throne to
be erected for her in a garden beside a lake, which no one
could ascend, save the person to whom she let down a
silken cord, and drew that person up to her.</p>

<p>Not far from the royal castle lived an old woman, the
same that had given the prince the counsel about the three
lemons. She had a servant, a gipsy, whom she was in the
habit of sending to the lake for water. She knew very well
that the young king had obtained a wife, and it annoyed her
excessively that he had not invited her to the wedding,
nay, had not even thanked her for her good advice. One
day she sent her maidservant to the lake for water. She
went, drew water, and saw a beautiful image in the water.
Under the impression that this was her own reflection, she
banged her pitcher on the ground, so that it flew into a
thousand pieces. &lsquo;Are you worthy,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;that so
beautiful a person as myself should carry water for an old
witch like you?&rsquo; As she uttered this she looked up, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
lo! it wasn&rsquo;t her own reflection that she saw in the water,
but that of the beautiful queen. Ashamed, she picked up
the pieces and returned home. The old woman, who knew
beforehand what had occurred, went out to meet her with
a fresh pitcher, and asked her servant, for appearance&rsquo; sake,
what had happened to her. The servant related all as it
had occurred. &lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s nothing!&rsquo; said the old woman.
&lsquo;But, do you know what? Go you once more to the lake,
and ask the lady to let down the silken cord and draw you
up, promising to comb and dress her hair. If she draws
you up, you will comb her hair, and when she falls asleep,
stick this pin into her head. Then dress yourself in her
clothes and sit there as queen.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t necessary to use much persuasion to the gipsy;
she took the pin, took the pitcher, and returned to the
lake. She drew water and looked at the beautiful queen.
&lsquo;Dear me! how beautiful you are! Ah! you are beautiful!&rsquo;
she screamed, and looked with coaxing gestures into her
eyes. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;but you would be a hundred times
more beautiful if you would let me comb and dress your
hair; in truth, I would so twine those golden locks that
your lord could not help being delighted.&rsquo; And thus she
jabbered, thus she coaxed, till the queen let down the silken
cord and drew her up.</p>

<p>The nasty gipsy combed, separated, and plaited the golden
hair till the beautiful queen fell sound asleep. Then the
gipsy drew out the pin, and stuck it into the sleeping queen&rsquo;s
head. At that moment a beautiful white dove flew off the
golden throne, and not a vestige remained of the lovely
queen save her handsome clothes, in which the gipsy speedily
dressed herself, took her seat in the place where the queen
sat before, and gazed into the lake; but the beautiful
reflection displayed itself no more in the lake, for even in the
queen&rsquo;s clothes the gipsy nevertheless remained a gipsy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
The young king was successful in overcoming his enemies,
and made peace with them. Scarcely had he returned to
the town, when he went to the garden to seek his delight,
and to see whether anything had happened to her. But
who shall express his astonishment and horror, when, instead
of his beautiful queen, he beheld a sorry gipsy. &lsquo;Ah, my
dear, my very dear one, how you have altered!&rsquo; sighed he,
and tears bedewed his cheeks. &lsquo;I have altered, my beloved!
I have altered; for anxiety for you has tortured me,&rsquo; answered
the gipsy, and wanted to fall upon his neck; but the king
turned away from her and departed in anger. From that
time forth he had no settled abode, no rest; he knew
neither day nor night; but merely mourned over the lost
beauty of his wife, and nothing could comfort him.</p>

<p>Thus agitated and melancholy, he was walking one day
in the garden. Here, as he moved about at haphazard, a
beautiful white dove flew on to his hand from a high tree,
and looked with mournful gaze into his bloodshot eyes.
&lsquo;Ah, my dove! why are you so sad? Has your mate been
transformed like my beautiful wife?&rsquo; said the young king,
talking to it and caressingly stroking its head and back.
But feeling a kind of protuberance on its head, he blew the
feathers apart, and behold! the head of a pin! Touched
with compassion, the king extracted the pin; that instant
the beautiful mourning dove was changed into his beautiful
wife. She narrated to him all that had happened to her,
and how it had happened; how the gipsy had deluded her,
and how she had stuck the pin into her head. The king
immediately caused the gipsy and the old woman to be
apprehended and burnt without further ado.</p>

<p>From that time forth nothing interfered with his happiness,
neither the might of his enemies nor the spite of wicked
people. He lived with his beautiful wife in peace and love;
he reigned prosperously, and is reigning yet, if he be yet alive.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap11" id="chap11"></a>XI.&mdash;THE SUN-HORSE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once upon a time a country, sad and gloomy
as the grave, on which God&rsquo;s sun never shone. But there
was a king there, and this king possessed a horse with a
sun on his forehead; and this sun-horse of his the king
caused to be led up and down the dark country, from one
end to the other, that the people might be able to exist
there; and light came from him on all sides wherever he
was led, just as in the most beautiful day.</p>

<p>All at once the sun-horse disappeared. A darkness worse
than that of night prevailed over the whole country, and
nothing could disperse it. Unheard-of terror spread among
the subjects; frightful misery began to afflict them, for they
could neither manufacture anything nor earn anything, and
such confusion arose among them that everything was
turned topsy-turvy. The king, therefore, in order to liberate
his realm and prevent universal destruction, made ready to
seek the sun-horse with his whole army.</p>

<p>Through thick darkness he made his way as best he could
to the frontier of his realm. Over dense mountains thousands
of ages old God&rsquo;s light began now to break from another
country, as if the sun were rising in the morning out of
thick fogs. On such a mountain the king came with his
army to a poor lonely cottage. He went in to inquire
where he was, what it was, and how to get further. At a
table sat a peasant, diligently reading in an open book.
When the king bowed to him he raised his eyes, thanked
him, and stood up. His whole person announced that he
was not a man like another man, but a seer.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I was just reading about you,&rsquo; said he to the king, &lsquo;how
that you are going to seek the sun-horse. Journey no
further, for you will not obtain him; but rely on me: I will
find him for you.&rsquo; &lsquo;I promise you, good man, I will recompense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
you royally,&rsquo; replied the king, &lsquo;if you bring him here
to me.&rsquo; &lsquo;I require no recompense; return home with your
army&mdash;you&rsquo;re wanted there; only leave me one servant.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The next day the seer set out with the servant. The
way was far and long, for they passed through six countries,
and had still further to go, till in the seventh country they
stopped at the royal palace. In this seventh country ruled
three own brothers, who had to wife three own sisters, whose
mother was a witch. When they stopped in front of the
palace, the seer said to his servant: &lsquo;Do you hear? you
stay here, and I will go in to ascertain whether the kings
are at home; for the horse with the sun is in their possession&mdash;the
youngest rides upon him.&rsquo; Therewith he transformed
himself into a green bird, and, flying on the gable
of the eldest queen&rsquo;s roof, flew up and down and pecked at
it until she opened the window and let him into her chamber.
And when she let him in he perched on her white
hand, and the queen was as delighted with him as a little
child. &lsquo;Ah, what a dear creature you are!&rsquo; said she, as she
played with him; &lsquo;if my husband were at home he would
indeed be delighted with you; but he won&rsquo;t come till
evening; he has gone to visit the third part of his country.&rsquo;</p>

<p>All at once the old witch came into the room, and, seeing
the bird, screamed to her daughter, &lsquo;Wring the accursed
bird&rsquo;s neck, for it&rsquo;s making you bleed!&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, what if it
should make me bleed? it&rsquo;s such a dear; it&rsquo;s such an
innocent dear!&rsquo; answered the daughter. But the witch
said: &lsquo;Dear innocent mischief! here with him! let me
wring his neck!&rsquo; and dashed at it. But the bird cunningly
transformed itself into a man, and, pop! out through the
door, and they didn&rsquo;t know whither he had betaken himself.</p>

<p>Afterwards he again transformed himself into a green
bird, flew on the gable of the middle sister, and pecked at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
it till she opened the window for him. And when she let
him in he flew on to her white hand, and fluttered from one
hand to the other. &lsquo;Oh, what a dear creature you are!&rsquo;
cried the queen, smiling; &lsquo;my husband would indeed be
delighted with you if he were at home; but he won&rsquo;t come
till to-morrow evening; he has gone to visit two thirds of
his kingdom.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon the witch burst into the room. &lsquo;Wring the
accursed bird&rsquo;s neck! wring its neck, for it&rsquo;s making you
bleed!&rsquo; cried she as soon as she espied it. &lsquo;Well, what if
it should make me bleed? it&rsquo;s such a dear, such an innocent
dear!&rsquo; replied the daughter. But the witch said:
&lsquo;Dear innocent mischief! here with it! let me wring its
neck!&rsquo; and was already trying to seize it. But at that
moment the green bird changed itself into a man, ran out
through the door, and disappeared, as it were, in the clap
of a hand, so that they didn&rsquo;t know whither he had gone.</p>

<p>A little while afterwards he changed himself again into a
green bird and flew on the gable of the youngest queen&rsquo;s
roof, and flew up and down, and pecked at it until she
opened the window to him. And when she had let him
in he flew straight on to her white hand, and made himself
so agreeable to her that she played with him with the
delight of a child. &lsquo;Ah, what a dear creature you are!&rsquo;
said the queen; &lsquo;if my husband were at home he would
certainly be delighted with you, but he won&rsquo;t come till the
day after to-morrow at even; he has gone to visit all three
parts of his kingdom.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At that moment the old witch came into the room.
&lsquo;Wring, wring the accursed bird&rsquo;s neck!&rsquo; screamed she in
the doorway, &lsquo;for it is making you bleed.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, what if
it should make me bleed, mother? it is so beautiful, so
innocent,&rsquo; answered the daughter. The witch said, &lsquo;Beautiful
innocent mischief! here with him! let me wring his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
neck!&rsquo; But at that moment the bird changed itself into a
man, and pop! out through the door, so that none of them
saw him more.</p>

<p>Now the seer knew where the kings were, and when they
would arrive. He went to his servant and ordered him to
follow him out of the town. On they went with rapid step
till they came to a bridge, over which the kings were obliged
to pass.</p>

<p>Under this bridge they stayed waiting till the evening.
When at even the sun was sinking behind the mountains,
the clatter of a horse was heard near the bridge. It was the
eldest king returning home. Close to the bridge his horse
stumbled over a log of wood, which the seer had thrown
across the bridge. &lsquo;Ha! what scoundrel was that who
threw this log across the road?&rsquo; exclaimed the king in anger.
Thereat the seer sprang out from under the bridge and
rushed upon the king for &lsquo;daring to call him a scoundrel,&rsquo;
and, drawing his sword, attacked him. The king, too, drew
his sword to defend himself, but after a short combat fell
dead from his horse. The seer bound the dead king on the
horse, and gave the horse a lash with the whip to make him
carry his dead master home. He then withdrew under the
bridge, and they waited there till the next evening.</p>

<p>When day a second time declined towards evening, the
middle king came to the bridge, and, seeing the ground
sprinkled with blood, cried out, &lsquo;Somebody&rsquo;s been killed
here! Who has dared to perpetrate such a crime in my
kingdom?&rsquo; At these words the seer sprang out from under
the bridge and rushed upon the king with drawn sword,
exclaiming, &lsquo;How dare you insult me? Defend yourself as
best you can!&rsquo; The king did defend himself, but after a
brief struggle yielded up his life under the sword of the seer.
The seer again fastened his corpse upon the horse, and gave
the horse a lash with the whip to make him carry his dead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
master home. They then withdrew under the bridge and
waited till the third evening came.</p>

<p>The third evening, at the very setting of the sun, up darted
the youngest king on the sun-horse, darted up with speed, for
he was somewhat late; but when he saw the red blood in
front of the bridge, he stopped, and gazing at it exclaimed,
&lsquo;It is an unheard-of villain who has dared to murder a man
in my kingdom!&rsquo; Scarcely had these words issued from his
mouth when the seer placed himself before him with drawn
sword, sternly bidding him defend himself, &lsquo;for he had
wounded his honour.&rsquo; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how,&rsquo; answered the
king, &lsquo;unless it is you that are the villain.&rsquo; But as his
adversary attacked him with a sword, he, too, drew his, and
defended himself manfully.</p>

<p>It had been mere play to the seer to overcome the first
two kings, but it was not so with this one. Long time they
fought, and broke their swords, yet victory didn&rsquo;t show itself
either on the one side or on the other. &lsquo;We shall effect
nothing with swords,&rsquo; said the seer, &lsquo;but do you know what?
Let us turn ourselves into wheels and start down from the
hill; the wheel which breaks shall be the conquered.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Good!&rsquo; said the king; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be a cart-wheel, and you shall
be a lighter wheel.&rsquo; &lsquo;Not so,&rsquo; cunningly said the seer; &lsquo;you
shall be the lighter wheel, and I will be the cart-wheel;&rsquo; and
the king agreed to it. Then they went up the hill, turned
themselves into wheels, and started downwards. The cart-wheel
flew to pieces, and bang! right into the lighter wheel,
so that it all smashed up. Immediately the seer arose out
of the cart-wheel and joyfully exclaimed, &lsquo;There you are, the
victory is mine!&rsquo; &lsquo;Not a bit of it, sir brother!&rsquo; cried the
king, placing himself in front of the seer; &lsquo;you have only
broken my fingers. But do you know what? Let us make
ourselves into flames, and the flame which burns up the
other shall be the victor. I will make myself into a red
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
flame, and do you make yourself into a bluish one.&rsquo; &lsquo;Not
so!&rsquo; interrupted the seer; &lsquo;you make yourself into a bluish
flame, and I will make myself into a red one.&rsquo; The king
agreed to this also. They went into the road to the bridge,
and, changing themselves into flames, began to burn each
other unmercifully. Long did they burn each other, but
nothing came of it. Thereupon, by coincidence, up came
an old beggar with a long gray beard, a bald head, a large
scrip at his side, leaning upon a thick staff. &lsquo;Old father!&rsquo;
said the bluish flame, &lsquo;bring some water and quench this
red flame; I&rsquo;ll give you a penny for it.&rsquo; The red flame
cunningly exclaimed, &lsquo;Old father! I&rsquo;ll give you a shilling if
you&rsquo;ll pour the water on this bluish flame.&rsquo; The old beggar
liked the shilling better than the penny, brought water and
quenched the bluish flame. Then it was all over with the
king. The red flame turned itself into a man, took the sun-horse
by the bridle, mounted on his back, called the servant,
thanked the beggar for the service he had rendered, and
went off.</p>

<p>In the royal palaces there was deep grief at the murder of
the two kings; the entire palaces were draped with black
cloth, and the people crowded into them from all quarters
to gaze at the cut and slashed bodies of the two elder brothers,
whose horses had brought them home. The old witch,
exasperated at the death of her sons-in-law, devised a plan
of vengeance on their murderer, the seer. She seated herself
with speed on an iron rake, took her three daughters
under her arms, and pop! off with them into the air.</p>

<p>The seer and his servant had already got through a good
part of their journey, and were then crossing desert mountains,
a treeless waste. Here a terrible hunger seized the
servant, and there wasn&rsquo;t even a wild plum to assuage it.
All of a sudden they came to an apple-tree. Apples were
hanging on it; the branches were all but breaking under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
their weight; their scent was beautiful; they were delightfully
ruddy, so that they almost offered themselves to be
eaten. &lsquo;Praise be to God!&rsquo; cried the delighted servant; &lsquo;I
shall eat one of those apples with an excellent appetite.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t attempt to gather one of them!&rsquo; cried the seer to
him; &lsquo;wait, I&rsquo;ll gather some for you myself.&rsquo; But instead
of plucking an apple, he drew his sword and thrust it
mightily into the apple-tree; red blood spouted out of it.
&lsquo;There,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you would have come to harm if you had
eaten any of those apples, for the apple-tree was the eldest
queen, whose mother placed her there to put us out of this
world.&rsquo;</p>

<p>After a time they came to a spring; water clear as crystal
bubbled up in it, all but running over the brim and thus
attracting wayfarers. &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the servant, &lsquo;if we can&rsquo;t
get anything better, let us at any rate have a drink of this
good water.&rsquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t venture to drink of it!&rsquo; shouted the
seer; &lsquo;but stay, I&rsquo;ll get you some of it.&rsquo; Yet he didn&rsquo;t get
him any water, but thrust his drawn sword into the midst of
it; it was immediately discoloured with blood, which began
to flow from it in mighty waves. &lsquo;That is the middle queen,
whose mother placed her here to put us out of this world,&rsquo;
said the seer, and the servant thanked him for his warning,
and went on, would he, nould he, in hunger and thirst,
whithersoever the seer led him.</p>

<p>After a time they came to a rose-bush, which was red with
delightful roses, and filled the air round about with their
scent. &lsquo;Oh, what beautiful roses!&rsquo; said the servant; &lsquo;I
never saw such beauties in all my life. I&rsquo;ll go and gather a
few of them; I will at any rate comfort myself with them if
I can&rsquo;t assuage my hunger and thirst.&rsquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t venture to
gather one of them!&rsquo; cried the seer; &lsquo;I will gather them for
you.&rsquo; With that he cut into the bush with his sword; red
blood spurted out, as if he had cut the vein of a human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
being. &lsquo;That is the youngest queen,&rsquo; said the seer to his
servant, &lsquo;whom her mother, the witch, placed here with the
intention of taking vengeance upon us for the death of her
sons-in-law.&rsquo; They then went on.</p>

<p>When they crossed the frontier of the dark realm, flashes
flew in all directions from the horse&rsquo;s forehead, and everything
came to life again, beautiful regions rejoiced and
blossomed with the flowers of spring. The king didn&rsquo;t
know how to thank the seer sufficiently, and offered him
the half of his kingdom as a reward, but he declined it.
&lsquo;You are king,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;rule over the whole realm, and I
will return to my cottage in peace.&rsquo; He took leave and
departed.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap12" id="chap12"></a>XII.&mdash;THE GOLDEN SPINSTER.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Far</span> away somewhere beyond the Red Sea, there was a
certain young lord. When he had grown up in body and
mind, he bethought himself that indeed it would not be a
bad thing to look round him in the world and seek out a
nice wife for himself, and a good mistress for his household.
Well, as he determined, so he did. He went out into the
world, but could not find such a one as he would have
liked. At last he went somehow into the house of a
widow, who had three daughters, all maidens. The two
elder were as active as wasps for work, but the youngest,
who was named Hanka, was like a leaden bird for everything
that wanted doing. When the young lord came to them
at spinning time he was astounded. &lsquo;How is it,&rsquo; thought
he, &lsquo;that Hanka can be sleeping in the chimney-corner, while
the other spinsters are hard at work at their tasks?&rsquo; He
said to their mother: &lsquo;But, old lady, tell me, why don&rsquo;t
you make that one, too, take a distaff? She is quite a
grown-up girl, and would amuse herself by work.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
young sir,&rsquo; replied the mother, &lsquo;I would allow her to spin
with all my heart; I would fill her distaff myself; but what
then? She is such a spinster, that by herself she would by
morning spin up not only all our spinning materials, but all
the thatch from the roof, and that into golden threads; nay,
at last she would betake herself to my gray hairs; I am
obliged, therefore, to give her a holiday.&rsquo; &lsquo;If this be so,&rsquo;
said the delighted suitor, &lsquo;and if it is God&rsquo;s will, you can
give her to me to wife. You see, I have a nice establishment&mdash;flax,
hemp, whole heaps of the finer and commoner
kinds of tow; she could spin away to her heart&rsquo;s content.&rsquo;
At such language the old woman did not take long for
consideration, and Hanka woke from her slumbers. They
brought the bridegroom expectant a handsome olive-coloured
handkerchief out of the clothes-chest, adorned him with
periwinkles, and performed the marriage ceremony that very
evening. The other spinsters were somewhat mortified at
Hanka&rsquo;s good fortune, but finally were content at it, hoping
that they, too, would get rings on their fingers,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> now that
the idle hand, as they nicknamed Hanka, had obtained a
husband. The next day our young bridegroom ordered his
horses to be harnessed, and when all was ready, placed the
tearful bride beside him in a handsome carriage, gave his
hand to his mother-in-law, called out &lsquo;Farewell!&rsquo; to the
bride&rsquo;s sisters, and they left the village at a gallop.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_3_3">[3]</a></span>
Literally, &lsquo;Would come under the garland.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>For better or worse! Poor Hanka sat by her youthful
husband mournful and tearful, just as if the chickens had
eaten up all her bread. He talked to her enough, but
Hanka was as mute as a fish. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with
you?&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened. At my house,
indeed, there will be no going to sleep for you. I shall give
you all that your heart desires. You will have flax, hemp,
fine and coarse tow enough for the whole winter, and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
have got in a store of apples for spittle.&rsquo; But our Hanka
became more sorrowful the further they went. Thus they
arrived in the evening at the young lord&rsquo;s castle, got down
from the carriage, and, after supper, the future lady was
conducted into a large room, in which, from top to bottom,
lay nothing but spinning materials. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;here
you have distaff, spindle, and spindle-ring, and rosy apples
and a few peas for spittle&mdash;spin away! If you spin all this,
by morning, into golden threads, we shall be man and wife
at once; if not, I shall cause you to be put to death without
further ado.&rsquo; Thereupon the young lord went out and left
the spinster to spin. When Hanka was left alone, she
didn&rsquo;t seat herself under the distaff, for she didn&rsquo;t even know
how to twirl the threads, but began sorrowfully to exclaim:
&lsquo;Oh God! God! here I am come out to vile disgrace!
Why did not my mother teach me to work and spin like
my two sisters? I might then have reposed in peace at
home; but, as it is, sinful creature that I am, I must perish
miserably.&rsquo; As she was thus expressing her feelings, the
wall suddenly opened, and a little mannikin stood before
the terrified Hanka, with a red cap on his head and an
apron girt round his waist; before him he pushed a little
golden hand-cart. &lsquo;Why have you your eyes so tearful?&rsquo;
inquired he of Hanka. &lsquo;What has happened to you?&rsquo;
&lsquo;As if, sinful soul that I am, I should not weep,&rsquo; said she;
&lsquo;only think, they have ordered me to spin all these spinning
materials into golden threads by morning, and if I don&rsquo;t do
so, they will have me put to death without any ceremony.
Oh God! God! what shall I do, forlorn in this strange
world?&rsquo; &lsquo;If that is all,&rsquo; said the mannikin, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be
frightened. I will teach you to spin golden threads cleverly;
but only on this condition, that I find you this time next
year in this very place. Then, if you do not guess my
honourable name, you will become my wife, and I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
convey you away in this cart. But, if you guess it, I shall
leave you in peace. But this I tell you: if you choose to
hide yourself anywhere this time next year, and if you fly ever
so far beneath the sky, I shall find you, and will wring your
neck. Well, have you agreed to this?&rsquo; It was not, sooth to
say, very satisfactory to Hanka; but what could the poor
thing do? At length she bethought herself: &lsquo;Let it be
left to God, whether I perish this way or that! I agree.&rsquo;
The mannikin, on hearing this, made three circuits round
her with his golden cart, seated himself under the distaff,
and repeating:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&lsquo;Thus, Haniczka, thus!</div>
<div class="i0">Thus, Haniczka, thus!</div>
<div class="i0">Thus, Haniczka, thus!&rsquo;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>taught and instructed her to spin golden threads. After
this, as he came, so he departed, and the wall closed up
of itself behind him. Our damsel, from that time forth a
real golden spinster, sat under the distaff, and seeing how
the spinning materials decreased and the golden threads
increased, spun and spun away, and by morning had not
only spun up all, but had had a good sleep into the bargain.
In the morning, as soon as the young lord awoke, he dressed
himself and went to visit the golden spinster. When he
entered the room he was all but blinded by the glitter, and
wouldn&rsquo;t even believe his eyes, that it was all gold. But
when he had satisfied himself that so it was, he began to
embrace the golden spinster, and declared her his true and
lawful wife. Thus they lived in the fear of God, and if our
young lord had previously loved his Haniczka for the
golden spinning, he then loved her a thousand times more
for the beautiful son that she in the meantime bore him.</p>

<p>But what? There&rsquo;s no footpath without an end, neither
could the joy of our wedded pair endure for ever. Day
passed after day, till finally the appointed time approached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
within a span. Now our Hanka began to be more sorrowful
from moment to moment; her eyes were as red as if they
were baked, and she did nothing but creep like a shadow
from room to room. And, indeed, it was a serious thing for
a young mother to have to lose all at once her good husband
and her beautiful son! Hitherto her poor husband knew
nought about anything, and comforted his wife as well as
he could; but she would not be comforted. When she
bethought herself what a nasty dwarf she was going to obtain
instead of her shapely husband, she all but dashed herself
against the walls from excessive agony. At last she managed
to overcome herself, and revealed everything to her husband
as it had occurred to her on that first night. He became,
from horror, as pale as a whitewashed wall, and caused proclamation
to be made throughout the whole district that, if
anyone knew of such a dwarf, and should make known his
real name, he would give him a piece of gold as large as his
head. &lsquo;Ah! what a windfall such a piece of gold as that
would be!&rsquo; whispered neighbour to neighbour, and they dispersed
on all sides, examined all corners, all but looked into
the mouseholes, searched and searched as for a needle, but,
after all, couldn&rsquo;t find anything out. Nobody knew and
nobody had seen the dwarf, and as for his name, no living
soul could guess it. Under such circumstances the last day
arrived; nothing had been seen or heard of the mannikin,
and our Hanka, with her boy at her breast, was wringing
her hands at the prospect of losing her husband. Her
unhappy husband, whose eyes were almost exhausted from
weeping, in order, at any rate, to escape from beholding the
agony of his wife, took his gun on his shoulder, fastened his
faithful hounds in a leash, and went out hunting. After
hunting time&mdash;it was about the hour of afternoon luncheon&mdash;it
began to lighten on all sides and in all directions, rain
poured so that it would have been a shame to turn a dog
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
out into the roads, and in this tempest all our young lord&rsquo;s
servants sought shelter where they could, and got so lost
that he remained with only one on a densely wooded
unknown hill, and that as soaked and dripping as a rat.
Where were they to seek shelter before the ever-increasing
storm? where to dry themselves? where to obtain harbour
for the night? The unlucky pair, master and servant, looked
round on all sides to see whether they couldn&rsquo;t espy a
shepherd&rsquo;s hut or a cattle-shed; but where nothing is, there
is nothing. Finally, when they had almost strained their
eyes out of the sockets, they saw where, out of the hole of
the side shaft of a mine, puffs of smoke were rolling, as from
a limekiln. &lsquo;Go, lad,&rsquo; said the young lord to the servant,
&lsquo;look whence this smoke issues; there must be people
there. Ask them whether they will give us lodging for the
night.&rsquo; The servant went off and returned in a jiffy with
the intelligence that neither door, nor shed, nor people were
there. &lsquo;Fie, you&rsquo;re only a duffer!&rsquo; said the lord to his
servant with chattering teeth. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go myself; you, for a
punishment, shall drip and freeze.&rsquo; Well, the noble lord
took the job in hand, but neither could he espy anything,
save that in one place smoke kept continually issuing out of
the side shaft. At last in disgust he said: &lsquo;Whatever devil
on devil may bring, know I must whence all this smoke
comes.&rsquo; So he went to the hole itself, knelt beside it and
peeped in. As he was thus peeping, he espied, somewhere
under ground, where food was cooking in a kitchen, and
covers were laid for two on a stone table. Round this table
ran a little mannikin in a red cap with a golden hand-cart
before him, and from time to time, after making the circuit,
he sang:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve manufactured a golden spinster for the young lord,</div>
<div class="i0">She will try to guess my name to night;</div>
<div class="i0">If she guesses my name aright, I shall leave her;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
<div class="i0">If she guesses it not, I shall take her:</div>
<div class="i0">My name is Martynko Klyngas.&rsquo;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And again he ran like mad round the table and shouted:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m preparing nine dishes for supper,</div>
<div class="i0">I&rsquo;ll place her in a silken bed;</div>
<div class="i0">If she guesses,&rsquo; etc.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The young lord wanted nothing more; he ran as fast as
his legs could carry him to his servant, and, as it now cleared
up a little, they were fortunate enough to find a path, by
which they hastened home. He found his wife at home in
agony, in misery, streaming with tears; for she thought she
would not be able even to take leave of her husband, as he
was so long away. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t afflict yourself, my wife,&rsquo; were
the young lord&rsquo;s first words when he entered the room. &lsquo;I
know what you require; his name is Martynko Klyngas.&rsquo;
And then he, without delay, recounted to her everything,
where he had gone and what had happened to him. Hanka
could scarcely keep on her feet for joy, embraced and kissed
her husband, and betook herself joyfully into the room, in
which she had spent the first night, to finish spinning the
golden threads. At midnight the wall opened, and the
mannikin with the red cap came in, as he had done that
time last year, and running round her with the golden cart
shouted with the utmost power of his lungs:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&lsquo;If you guess my name, I leave you;</div>
<div class="i0">If you guess it not, I take you;</div>
<div class="i2">Only guess, guess away!&rsquo;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have a try to guess,&rsquo; said Hanka; &lsquo;your name is
Martynko Klyngas.&rsquo; As soon as she had uttered this, the
little dwarf seized his cart, threw his cap on the ground, and
departed as he had come; the wall closed, and Hanka
breathed in peace. From that time forth she spun no more
gold, and, indeed, neither was it necessary for her so to do
for they were rich enough. She and her husband lived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
happily together, their boy grew like a young tree by the
water&rsquo;s side; and they bought a cow, and on the cow a bell,
and here&rsquo;s an end to the tale I tell.</p>

<hr class="rule" />

<p>[This story may be compared with &lsquo;Rumpelstiltskin&rsquo; in
Grimm. The principle is the same; but, I think, the
variation in the details is much in favour of the Slavonic
tale.]</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap13" id="chap13"></a>XIII.&mdash;ARE YOU ANGRY?</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Where</span> it was, there it was, a certain village there was, in
which lived a father with three sons. One of them was
silly, and always sat in the chimney corner,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> but the other
two were considered clever. One of these went out to
service in a village not far off. His mother put on his back
a wallet full of cakes baked under the ashes. He went into
a house and made an engagement with the master upon the
terms that whichever got angry first was to have his nose
cut off. The servant went to thresh. He was not called
by his master either to breakfast or to dinner. His master
asked him: &lsquo;Well, Mishek, are you angry?&rsquo; &lsquo;What have
I to be angry for?&rsquo; Evening came, and supper was cooked;
again they did not ask Mishek. His master asked him:
&lsquo;Well, Mishek, are you angry?&rsquo; &lsquo;What have I to be angry
for?&rsquo; He wasn&rsquo;t angry, for the cakes from home still held
out. But during the second and third day the wallet was
emptied, and again he wasn&rsquo;t summoned to dinner. His
master asked him: &lsquo;Mishek, are you not angry?&rsquo; &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t
even the devil be angry, when you are thus killing me with
hunger?&rsquo; Then his master pulled out a knife and cut off
Mishek&rsquo;s nose. He hastened home noseless, and complained
to his father and brothers of his wicked master. &lsquo;You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
simpleton!&rsquo; said the next brother, Pavko. &lsquo;Stay, I&rsquo;ll go!
Hey, mother, bake some cakes under the ashes!&rsquo; Pavko
started off and went straight to the same village and to the
same house, and made an engagement with the same master,
on the terms that whichever was the first to become angry
was to have his nose cut off. They set him, too, to thresh
for three days, but neither on the first, nor on the second,
nor on the third day, did they call him to take a meal.
&lsquo;Pavko, are you not angry?&rsquo; &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t even devils be angry
with you? My belly has already grown to my backbone.&rsquo;
Thereupon his master pulled out a knife and cut off Pavko&rsquo;s
nose. Pavko went home noseless, and said to his elder
brother: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a cruel house of entertainment; the devil&rsquo;s
got my nose.&rsquo; Then Adam, the youngest, shouted from the
chimney-corner: &lsquo;You are idiots! I&rsquo;ll go, and you&rsquo;ll see
that I shall make a good job of it.&rsquo; He went with cakes
baked under the ashes in his wallet, and hit right upon the
same village in which his brothers had been, and engaged
himself with the same master upon the terms that whichever
got angry first should have his nose cut off. But Adam
knew how to proceed intelligently. When his master didn&rsquo;t
call him to dinner, he went to the public-house with what
he had threshed and pawned it all. His master came and
didn&rsquo;t see a grain of corn. Adam then asked him:
&lsquo;Master, are you angry?&rsquo; &lsquo;Why should I be angry?&rsquo; This
occurred several times, and his master always said that
he wasn&rsquo;t angry, for fear of losing his nose. Once there
came a day on which the master and mistress were obliged
to be from home, and they ordered Adam by their return
to kill the first sheep that looked at him when he entered
the stable, to dress it and boil it in a caldron, putting
parsley with it. Adam went into the stable with great
banging and noise, so that all the sheep looked at him at
once, whereupon he slaughtered them all. One he dressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
and put in the caldron, but instead of parsley he threw in a
dog called by that name. His master and mistress came
and asked Adam whether he had done everything properly?
He said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve slaughtered the sheep and thrown Parsley
into the caldron till I saw his feet. Now, master, are you
angry?&rsquo; &lsquo;What have I to be angry about?&rsquo; he replied, for
he preferred keeping his nose. On Christmas Eve, when
they had to go to church, it was very dark. Adam&rsquo;s master
said to him: &lsquo;It would be a good thing if somebody would
light us as far as the church.&rsquo; &lsquo;Go! go! I&rsquo;ll light you.&rsquo;
He took fire and set the roof on fire, till the whole house
was in flames. The master hurried up, and Adam said to
him: &lsquo;Master, are you angry?&rsquo; &lsquo;Why should I be angry?&rsquo;
said he; for his nose was dearer to him than his house.
But what was he to do without a house, without everything?
They went into the world, master, mistress, and servant.
They wanted to put him to death; and planned together,
that when he was asleep his master should throw him into
the water. But Adam was up to this; he didn&rsquo;t lie down
on the side nearest the water, but got up in the night and
threw his mistress, who was on that side, into the water.
His master woke, and saw that his wife was gone; and
began to cry out. But Adam asked him: &lsquo;Well, master,
are you angry?&rsquo; &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t even the devil be angry, now
that you&rsquo;ve done me out of everything?&rsquo; Adam took a
knife and cut off his master&rsquo;s nose. He then took to his
heels, went home, and said to his brothers: &lsquo;Now you see,
you wiseacres, that I&rsquo;ve earned the nose.&rsquo;</p>

<h3><a name="part01d" id="part01d"></a><i>UPPER AND LOWER LUSATIAN STORIES.</i></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Upper Lusatian language is spoken in a district
which may be marked by the towns of L&ouml;bau, Bautzen,
and Muskau, while the Lower Lusatians dwell round the
towns of Spremberg and Kottbus. Of the Upper Lusatians
the larger portion live in Saxony and the smaller in Prussian
territory; the Lower Lusatians are all Prussian subjects.</p>

<p>The Upper Lusatian story illustrates, in folklore style,
a moral principle of great value. The Lower Lusatian tale
is a variant of our own &lsquo;Little Red Ridinghood.&rsquo; But it
completes the story in such a manner as to explain the
allegorical meaning of the narrative in the sense in which I
am inclined to interpret it, as will be shown at the conclusion
of the story.</p>

<p>But the Slavonic remnant in Lusatia is so surrounded by
German territory, that most of its folklore has already been
pressed into the service of the Germans.</p>

<p>A remarkable point in the Lusatian language is the
completeness of the dual number in both nouns, adjectives,
and verbs.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap14" id="chap14"></a>XIV.&mdash;RIGHT ALWAYS REMAINS RIGHT.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once upon a time a huntsman, who had a son,
who was also a huntsman. He sent his son into a foreign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
land, to look about him and learn something additional.
Here he went into a tavern, where he found a stranger, with
whom he entered into conversation. They told each other
all the news, till they also began to talk about right and
wrong. The stranger asserted that the greatest wrong
could be made right for money. But the huntsman opined
that right always remained right, and offered to bet three
hundred dollars upon it, if the stranger would do the same.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
The stranger was content therewith, and they agreed to ask
three advocates the question at once. They went to the first
advocate, and he said that it was possible to make wrong
right for money. They then went to another. He also
asserted that wrong could be made right for money. Finally,
they went to a third. He also told them that wrong could
be made right for money. They then went back again,
and as they had been going about the whole day, it wasn&rsquo;t
till late in the evening that they got to their tavern. The
stranger then asked the huntsman whether he still disbelieved
that the greatest wrong could be made right for
money, and the huntsman replied that he should soon be
obliged to believe it on the assertion of the three advocates,
although he was very unwilling to do so. The stranger was
willing to grant him his life if he consented to pay three
hundred dollars; but as they were talking about it, in came
a man who overpersuaded the stranger that he must needs
abide by what they had previously agreed upon. He did
not, however, do this, but only, with a red-hot iron, took
his eyesight from him, and told him at the same time, that
he would then and then only believe that right remained
right in the world, when the huntsman regained his sight.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_5_5">[5]</a></span>
This surely ought, from what transpires later in the story, to have
run thus: &lsquo;To stake his life against three hundred dollars to be staked
by the stranger.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The huntsman entreated the host of the tavern to put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
him on the right road to the town. He put him on the
road to the gallows, and went his way. When the huntsman
had gone a little further, there was the end of the road,
and he heard it strike eleven. He couldn&rsquo;t go any further,
and remained lying where he was in hope that perhaps
somebody would come there in the morning. After a short
time he heard a clatter, and soon somebody came up; nor
was it long before a second and a third arrived. These
were three evil spirits, who quitted their bodies in the night
time, and perpetrated all manner of villainy in the world.
They began to talk together, and one said: &lsquo;To-day it is a
year and a day since we were here together and related the
good deeds that we had done during the year before. A
year has again elapsed, and it is therefore time that we
should ascertain which of us has done the best action during
the past year.&rsquo; The first spoke, and said: &lsquo;I have deprived
the inhabitants of the city of Ramul of their water supply;
they can only be helped if somebody finds out what it is
that stops up the spring.&rsquo; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; said the second;
and the first replied: &lsquo;I have placed a great toad on the
spring out of which the water at other times flowed; if that
be removed, the water will spring up again as before.&rsquo; The
second said: &lsquo;I have caused the beauty of the princess of
Sarahawsky to disappear, and herself to fade away to skin
and bones; she cannot be helped until the silver nail, which
hangs above her bed, be pulled out.&rsquo; The third said:
&lsquo;Yesterday I caused a person to be deprived of his eyesight
with a red hot iron; he can only be helped by washing his
eyes with the water that is in the well not far from this
gallows.&rsquo; It then struck twelve in the town, and the three
disappeared at once, but the huntsman remembered all that
he had heard, and rejoiced that it was in his power to regain
his eyesight.</p>

<p>Early on the morrow he heard somebody passing by, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
begged him to send him people from the town, to tell where
the healing spring was. Then all manner of people came to
him, but no one could show him the spring, save at length
one old woman. He caused himself to be led thither, and
as soon as he had washed his eyes in it, he immediately
obtained his eyesight again.</p>

<p>He now asked the way to the city of Ramul, and went
thither. As soon as he arrived, he told the town council
that he would restore them their water. But plenty of
people had been there already, and the city had spent a
great deal of money upon them, yet no one had effected
aught, so, as it had been all in vain, they intended to have
nothing more to do with the matter. Well, he said that he
would do it all for nothing, only they must give him some
labourers to help him. It was done. When they had dug
as far as the place where the pipes, through which the water
used to flow, were laid into the spring, he sent all the workmen
away and dug a little further himself, and behold! a
toad, like a boiler, was sitting on the spring. He removed
it, and immediately the water began to flow, and ere long
all the fountains were filled with water. The citizens got
up a grand banquet in his honour, and paid him a large sum
of money for what he had done.</p>

<p>He then went on and came to Sarahawsky. Then in a
short time he learnt that the princess was ill, just as he had
heard, and that no physician was able to help her; moreover
that the king had promised that the person who could cure
her malady should obtain her to wife. He therefore
equipped himself very handsomely, went to the king&rsquo;s palace,
and there declared that he had come from a far country, and
would cure the princess. The king replied to him that he
had scarce any hope left, but would nevertheless make the
experiment with him. The huntsman said that he would
fetch his medicine. He went out and bought all manner of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
sweet comfits, and then went to the princess. He gave her
a first dose, and looked about to see in what part of her
bed&rsquo;s head the silver nail was sticking. Early on the
second day he came again, gave her again some of his
medicine, took the opportunity of laying hold of the nail,
and pulled it till it began to move. In the afternoon the
princess felt that she was better. The third day he came
again, and while the princess was taking the medicine,
pulled again at the bed&rsquo;s head, pulled the nail clean out, and
put it secretly into his pocket. At noon the princess was
so far recovered, that she wanted to have her dinner, and the
king invited the huntsman to a grand banquet. They
settled when the wedding was to take place, but the huntsman
considered that he must first go home.</p>

<p>And when he had got home, he went again to the tavern
where he had lost the sight of his eyes, and the stranger was
there also. They began to tell each other all the news,
and the huntsman related what he had heard under the
gallows; how he had discovered the water, and finally how
he had regained the sight of his eyes, and said that the
stranger must now believe that in the world right always
remained right. The stranger marvelled exceedingly, and
said that he would believe it.</p>

<p>After this the huntsman went on and came to his
princess, and they had a grand wedding festival, which
lasted a whole week. The stranger bethought himself that
he, too, would go under the gallows; peradventure he
might also hear some such things as the huntsman had
heard, and might in consequence also obtain a princess to
wife. And when the year had elapsed, he also went there.
He heard it strike one, and in a short time he heard a clatter;
then up came somebody again, and it wasn&rsquo;t long before a
second and third arrived. They began to talk together, and
one said: &lsquo;It cannot but be, that some one overheard us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
last year, and through that everything that we have done is
ruined. Let us, therefore, make a careful search before we
again recount to each other what we have done.&rsquo; They
immediately began to search, and found the stranger. They
tore him into three pieces and hung them up on the three
corners of the gallows.</p>

<p>When the old king died they took the huntsman for king,
and if he has not died, he is reigning still at the present day,
and firmly believes that in his realm right will always
remain right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time, there was a little darling damsel, whom
everybody loved that looked upon her, but her old granny
loved her best of all, and didn&rsquo;t know what to give the dear
child for love. Once she made her a hood of red samite,
and since that became her so well, and she, too, would wear
nothing else on her head, people gave her the name of &lsquo;Red
Hood.&rsquo; Once her mother said to Red Hood, &lsquo;Go; here is
a slice of cake and a bottle of wine; carry them to old
granny. She is ill and weak, and they will refresh her.
But be pretty behaved, and don&rsquo;t peep about in all corners
when you come into her room, and don&rsquo;t forget to say
&ldquo;Good-day.&rdquo; Walk, too, prettily, and don&rsquo;t go out of the
road, otherwise you will fall and break the bottle, and then
poor granny will have nothing.&rsquo; Red Hood said, &lsquo;I will
observe everything well that you have told me,&rsquo; and gave
her mother her hand upon it.</p>

<p>But granny lived out in a forest, half an hour&rsquo;s walk from
the village. When Red Hood went into the forest, she met
a wolf. But she did not know what a wicked beast he was,
and was not afraid of him. &lsquo;God help you, Red Hood!&rsquo;
said he. &lsquo;God bless you, wolf!&rsquo; replied she. &lsquo;Whither so
early, Red Hood?&rsquo; &lsquo;To granny.&rsquo; &lsquo;What have you there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
under your mantle?&rsquo; &lsquo;Cake and wine. We baked yesterday;
old granny must have a good meal for once, and
strengthen herself therewith.&rsquo; &lsquo;Where does your granny
live, Red Hood?&rsquo; &lsquo;A good quarter of an hour&rsquo;s walk
further in the forest, under yon three large oaks. There
stands her house; further beneath are the nut-trees, which
you will see there,&rsquo; said Red Hood. The wolf thought
within himself, &lsquo;This nice young damsel is a rich morsel.
She will taste better than the old woman; but you must
trick her cleverly, that you may catch both.&rsquo; For a time he
went by Red Hood&rsquo;s side. Then said he, &lsquo;Red Hood!
just look! there are such pretty flowers here! Why don&rsquo;t
you look round at them all? Methinks you don&rsquo;t even hear
how delightfully the birds are singing! You are as dull as
if you were going to school, and yet it is so cheerful in the
forest!&rsquo; Little Red Hood lifted up her eyes, and when she
saw how the sun&rsquo;s rays glistened through the tops of the
trees, and every place was full of flowers, she bethought
herself, &lsquo;If I bring with me a sweet smelling nosegay to
granny, it will cheer her. It is still so early, that I shall
come to her in plenty of time,&rsquo; and therewith she skipped
into the forest and looked for flowers. And when she had
plucked one, she fancied that another further off was nicer,
and ran there, and went always deeper and deeper into the
forest. But the wolf went by the straight road to old
granny&rsquo;s, and knocked at the door. &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; &lsquo;Little
Red Hood, who has brought cake and wine. Open!&rsquo; &lsquo;Only
press the latch,&rsquo; cried granny; &lsquo;I am so weak that I cannot
stand.&rsquo; The wolf pressed the latch, walked in, and went
without saying a word straight to granny&rsquo;s bed and ate her up.
Then he took her clothes, dressed himself in them, put her
cap on his head, lay down in her bed and drew the curtains.</p>

<p>Meanwhile little Red Hood was running after flowers,
and when she had so many that she could not carry any
more, she bethought her of her granny, and started on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
way to her. It seemed strange to her that the door was
wide open, and when she entered the room everything
seemed to her so peculiar, that she thought, &lsquo;Ah! my God!
how strange I feel to-day, and yet at other times I am so
glad to be with granny!&rsquo; She said, &lsquo;Good-day!&rsquo; but received
no answer. Thereupon she went to the bed and undrew
the curtains. There lay granny, with her cap drawn down
to her eyes, and looking so queer! &lsquo;Ah, granny! why have
you such long ears?&rsquo; &lsquo;The better to hear you.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah,
granny! why have you such large eyes?&rsquo; &lsquo;The better to
see you.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah, granny! why have you such large hands?&rsquo;
&lsquo;The better to take hold of you.&rsquo; &lsquo;But, granny! why have
you such a terribly large mouth?&rsquo; &lsquo;The better to eat you
up!&rsquo; And therewith the wolf sprang out of bed at once on
poor little Red Hood, and ate her up.</p>

<p>When the wolf had satisfied his appetite, he lay down
again in the bed, and began to snore tremendously. A
huntsman came past, and bethought himself, &lsquo;How can an
old woman snore like that? I&rsquo;ll just have a look to see
what it is.&rsquo; He went into the room, and looked into the
bed; there lay the wolf. &lsquo;Have I found you now, old
rascal?&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve long been looking for you.&rsquo; He
was just going to take aim with his gun, when he bethought
himself, &lsquo;Perhaps the wolf has only swallowed granny, and
she may yet be released;&rsquo; therefore he did not shoot, but
took a knife and began to cut open the sleeping wolf&rsquo;s maw.
When he had made several cuts, he saw a red hood gleam,
and after one or two more cuts out skipped Red Hood, and
cried, &lsquo;Oh, how frightened I have been; it was so dark in
the wolf&rsquo;s maw!&rsquo; Afterwards out came old granny, still
alive, but scarcely able to breathe. But Red Hood made
haste and fetched large stones, with which they filled the
wolf&rsquo;s maw, and when he woke he wanted to jump up and
run away, but the stones were so heavy that he fell on
the ground and beat himself to death. Now, they were all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
three merry. The huntsman took off the wolf&rsquo;s skin; granny
ate the cake and drank the wine which little Red Hood had
brought, and became strong and well again; and little Red
Hood thought to herself, &lsquo;As long as I live, I won&rsquo;t go out
of the road into the forest, when mother has forbidden me.&rsquo;</p>

<hr class="rule" />

<p>[Little Red Hood, like many folklore tales, is a singular
mixture of myth and morality. In Cox&rsquo;s &lsquo;Comparative
Mythology,&rsquo; vol. ii., p. 831, note, Little Redcap, or Little
Red Riding Hood, is interpreted as &lsquo;the evening with her
scarlet robe of twilight,&rsquo; who is swallowed up by the wolf of
darkness, the Fenris of the Edda. It appears to me that
this explanation may suit the colour of her cap or hood, but
is at variance with the other incidents of the story. I am
inclined to look upon the tale as a lunar legend, although
the moon is only actually red during one portion of the
year, at the harvest moon in the autumn. Red Hood is
represented as wandering, like Io, who is undoubtedly the
moon, through trees, the clouds, and flowers, the stars,
before she reaches the place where she is intercepted by the
wolf. An eclipse to untutored minds would naturally
suggest the notion that some evil beast was endeavouring
to devour the moon, who is afterwards rescued by the
sun, the archer of the heavens, whose bow and arrow are by
a common anachronism represented in the story by a gun.
Though the moon is masculine in Slavonic, as in German,
yet she is a lady, &lsquo;my lady Luna,&rsquo; in the Croatian legend
<a href="#chap53">No. 53</a>, below. In the Norse mythology, when Loki is
let loose at the end of the world, he is to &lsquo;hurry in the
form of a wolf to swallow the moon&rsquo; (Cox ii., p. 200). The
present masculine Slavonic word for moon, which is also that
for month, &lsquo;mesic,&rsquo; or &lsquo;mesec,&rsquo; is a secondary formation,
the original word having perished. In Greek and Latin
the moon is always feminine.]</p>

<h3><a name="part01e" id="part01e"></a><i>KASHUBIAN STORY.</i></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Kashubians inhabit a small district in the North-east
of Pomerania, &lsquo;the province upon the sea,&rsquo;
from <i>po</i>, upon, and <i>more</i>, the sea. The limits of the district
may be roughly marked by the towns of Leba, Lauenburg
and B&uuml;tow or Bytom.</p>

<p>The story contains many of the circumstances of the
German story of &lsquo;The Table, the Ass and the Stick&rsquo; in
Grimm&rsquo;s collection. The Kashubian tales again would
naturally be pressed into the service of the surrounding
Germans. Bitter complaints have been made by Slavonic
literati, that their Folklore tales have been appropriated
by the Germans. Of course there is a vast amount of
common ground in Folklore, and incidents belonging to
one tale will sometimes start up at a distance in another
apparently entirely unconnected with it. But I believe
that there is considerable ground for the complaint.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap16" id="chap16"></a>XVI.&mdash;CUDGEL, BESTIR YOURSELF!</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A cobbler</span> was busying himself on Saturday with mending
old shoes, that he might be able to go to church
on Sunday. He worked till late in the evening, and,
having finished his work, early in the morning dressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
himself, and took his book to service. In church he heard
this doctrine, that if any one dedicates his property to the
church, God will recompense him a hundredfold in another
form. And as he was poor, he therefore determined to
sell his cottage and goods and take the whole price to the
priest at the church. He went home and told his wife of
his intentions; and in a few days the money was in the
hands of the parson.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> But day passed after day, and
nothing was to be seen of a recompense. At last, when
hunger sorely tried the cobbler, he dressed himself like an
old beggar and went to seek for the Lord God. After
wandering a couple of days he met with an old shepherd,
who was pasturing a large flock of lambs. And as he was
very hungry, he made up his mind to go up to the old
shepherd, and ask him to give him a little to eat out of his
dinner-basket.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> During the meal he related all that he
had done, and how it was then going with him. The old
shepherd compassionated the poor cobbler, and gave him a
lamb, which scattered ducats at every call: &lsquo;Lamb, shake
yourself!&rsquo; but gave it him under the condition, that in one
village, through which he was obliged to pass, he was not to
enter the house of his old gossip. He laid the lamb on his
shoulder with great joy, thanked the old man for it, and
started with speed on his way home to rejoice his wife and
children. When he got behind the hill, he began to distrust
the words of the old shepherd, for he could not get it into
his head that an ordinary lamb would scatter ducats.
Wishing, therefore, to assure himself of their truth, he placed
the lamb on the ground and uttered the old man&rsquo;s words:
&lsquo;Lamb, shake yourself!&rsquo; and when at the self-same
moment he espied ducats round the lamb&rsquo;s feet, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
considered himself the most fortunate man in the whole world.
Without delay he put the lamb on his back, and went on
towards home. But when he went past his gossip&rsquo;s tavern,
she besought him to pay her a visit, for they had not seen
each other for a very long time. The cobbler at first
hesitated a little, but wishing to show that he had ducats
in his pocket, and that he had met with such good fortune,
he went into the tavern; and, after first giving into her
charge his present from the old man, with these words,
&lsquo;But don&rsquo;t say to him, &ldquo;Lamb, shake yourself!&rdquo;&rsquo; went to
the table and drank off a noggin of brandy. But his
gossip, a knavish old woman, bethought herself at once
that there must be some secret lying in these words. She,
therefore, took the lamb into another room, and when she
was there by herself, said to the lamb: &lsquo;Lamb, shake
yourself!&rsquo; when she saw that he scattered ducats she
began to consider how to cheat her gossip. After a short
time she determined to make the cobbler drunk, to detain
him all night at her house, and next day, early, to give him
instead of his lamb another like it out of her own flock;
which was effected according to her intention. Well,
early in the morning the cobbler took the lamb on his
shoulder and now hastened straight to his wife and children,
and tossed them, as they wept, a couple of ducats, that his
wife might get a good meal ready. His wife could not
wonder enough whence her little husband had got so much
money, but she did not venture to question him. After the
meal the cobbler put the lamb on the table, called his
children, that they might enjoy with him the rolling ducats,
and shouted: &lsquo;Lamb, shake yourself!&rsquo; But the lamb stood
as if he were made of wood, and never even moved his head.
The children, who had eaten their fill, began to laugh, and
the wife thought that her husband was not quite right in
his head. The cobbler, angry that his wish had not come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
to pass, repeated once more the old man&rsquo;s words, but this
time, too, without effect, therefore he pushed the lamb off
the table. So long as the ducats held out, there was content
in the home; but as soon as they began to run short in
the cottage, his wife began to reproach her husband for
doing no work, and not troubling himself about a livelihood.
So nothing again remained for the cobbler but, stick in
hand, to go to look for the old man. He knew very well
what a bad welcome he would receive from him, but what
was to be done? However, the old man had compassion
on the poor family, and this time gave him a tablecloth,
which at every summons: &lsquo;Tablecloth, spread yourself!&rsquo;
spread itself of its own accord, and on it stood most
excellent food and drink; but under the condition that he
didn&rsquo;t go into his gossip&rsquo;s house. The cobbler, well content
with the present, thanked the old man and moved towards
home. In a short time he was behind the hill, sat down
upon the ground, and, not from curiosity but from hunger,
gave the word of command to the tablecloth to spread
itself, for his inside was croaking. When, after eating his
fill, he went past the tavern, his old gossip was waiting for
him in front of the door; she begged him in the kindest
terms not to pass her tavern, adding the proverb: &lsquo;Whoever
passes a tavern sprains his foot.&rsquo; The cobbler wavered
long, but at last went in and entrusted her with the tablecloth
with these words: &lsquo;Dear gossip, don&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;Tablecloth,
spread yourself!&rdquo;&rsquo; The crafty woman gave him brandy
in welcome, not for money; therefore, her gossip tossed off
noggin after noggin, till there came a dizziness in his head.
Then his gossip did the same with the tablecloth as with
the lamb. The cobbler came to his wife and children,
placed the tablecloth on the table and cried: &lsquo;Tablecloth,
spread yourself!&rsquo; But the tablecloth didn&rsquo;t stir, and the
cobbler began to despair and to revile the old woman, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
gossip. He returned again to the old man, begged pardon
of him on his knees for not fulfilling the condition that
time also, and prayed him, nevertheless, to have compassion
on him and to be his preserver once more. The old man
for a long time refused, but at last gave him a cudgel with
a silver mounting set with precious stones, and ordered him
this time to visit his gossip, and take note of these words:
&lsquo;Cudgel, bestir yourself!&rsquo; The cobbler, seized with new joy,
thanked the old man a hundred times, and made the more
haste towards his wife and children. Still, when behind the
hill, he was curious to know what the cudgel meant, and wishing
to satisfy himself, said: &lsquo;Cudgel, bestir yourself!&rsquo; In
a moment there stood before him a couple of stout fellows,
who began to thrash him mercilessly. The cobbler, seized
by cruel terror, did not know how to order them to cease
beating him; at last, when already well beaten, he cried out:
&lsquo;Cudgel, leave off!&rsquo; Instantly the fellows disappeared and
the cudgel stood before him. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re good, you&rsquo;re good!&rsquo;
said the cobbler, getting up from the ground, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll help
me to those former gifts.&rsquo; When he arrived at the village,
where his gossip lived, he stepped into her house and made
himself at home as with an old acquaintance. She was
very glad to see him, for she thought she would again make
a good profit, entertained him well, and afterwards began to
inquire whether he hadn&rsquo;t something for her to take charge of.
Then the cobbler gave up to her his cudgel with the request
not to say: &lsquo;Cudgel, bestir yourself!&rsquo; The old woman
laughed in her sleeve at the simpleton, thinking to herself,
&lsquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t tell me without cause what I&rsquo;m not to say!&rsquo;
She went at once with the cudgel into the other room, and
scarcely had she crossed the threshold, when she cried out
impatiently: &lsquo;Cudgel, bestir yourself!&rsquo; Immediately the two
fellows with cudgels began to beat her, and she lost all
self-possession. At her piercing shrieks the host darted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
up to help her, when, hey ho! he got it too. The cobbler
all the time kept calling out: &lsquo;Go it, cudgel! go it! till they
give me back my lamb and my tablecloth!&rsquo; Then nothing
remained to his gossip but to give up his property to him.
She ordered the lamb and tablecloth to be brought. As
soon as the cobbler had satisfied himself that this was
really done, he shouted &lsquo;Cudgel, leave off!&rsquo; and went with
the three gifts as quick as he could to his wife and children.
Then there was great joy, for they had money and victuals
in abundance; and did not withal forget God and other
people, but assisted every poor person.</p>

<h3><a name="part01f" id="part01f"></a><i>POLISH STORIES.</i></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Polish language is one of great beauty and flexibility,
but it is disfigured by an orthography which
causes English readers to imagine that it is very difficult to
pronounce, which is by no means the case. The letter <i>z</i> in
Polish performs the office frequently assigned to <i>h</i> in English,
viz., that of softening the preceding consonant without
possessing any further power of its own. Thus <i>cz</i> is the
exact equivalent in Polish of our <i>ch</i>, and <i>sz</i> exactly represents
our <i>sh</i>. The other grand peculiarities of the Polish language
are the sibillated <i>r</i>, written <i>rz</i>, the retention of the nasal
sounds of long <i>a</i> (as <i>on</i>) and long <i>e</i> (as <i>en</i> in French), and
the dull <i>l</i>, represented by a curved stroke through the letter
<i>l</i>, which has the sound of our final <i>ll</i> in &lsquo;bull,&rsquo; but is somewhat
difficult to pronounce at the beginning or in the middle
of a word.</p>

<p>Poland, or rather Lithuania, the aristocracy of which is
Polish, has produced a really great poet, Mickiewicz, whose
poems are so beautiful, that it would be worth while for a
literary person of leisure to study the language for the mere
purpose of reading them. See Morfill&rsquo;s &lsquo;Russia&rsquo; (Sampson
Low, 1880), pp. 207-212. One of the most celebrated of
Mickiewicz&rsquo;s poems, &lsquo;Pan Taddeus,&rsquo; has lately been translated
by Miss M.&nbsp;A. Biggs (Tr&uuml;bner and Co.).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
In the Polish story, <a href="#chap17">No. 17</a>, we make acquaintance with
&lsquo;Kostchey the Deathless,&rsquo; who plays a great part in Russian
stories, but is entirely unknown by name among the
southern and most of the western Slavonians. His place is
with them taken by dragons and evil shapes of various kinds.
His name is probably derived from <i>kost</i>, a &lsquo;bone,&rsquo; and I
have ventured to Anglicize it accordingly. He is generally
supposed to symbolize winter, and certainly deciduous
trees and bushes then exhibit a very skeleton-like appearance.
In a story from the government of Perm, given by
Mr. Ralston, the secret of his immortality is discovered,
and he is put to death accordingly. But I cannot help
inferring that his death is of annual occurrence, and that he
resumes his reign annually at the proper season, to be again
put to death towards spring. With <a href="#chap18">No. 18</a> several Russian
tales given by Mr. Ralston (pp. 185-193) may be compared.
<a href="#chap19">No. 19</a> is a singular story of a more Oriental than European
cast, and <a href="#chap20">No. 20</a> reads as much like a dream dreamed after
the consumption of a considerable quantity of <i>vodka</i>, as a
genuine Folklore story. Such is also the case with several
of Crofton Croker&rsquo;s Legends of the south of Ireland.</p>

<p>Tale <a href="#chap17">No. 17</a> has already appeared in the &lsquo;Folklore
Journal&rsquo; for January, 1884. For mere beauty of construction
and narration I doubt whether its equal can be found
in any language.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap17" id="chap17"></a>XVII.&mdash;PRINCE UNEXPECTED.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a king and queen who had been married for
three years, but had no children, at which they were both
much distressed. Once upon a time the king found himself
obliged to make a visit of inspection round his
dominions; he took leave of his queen, set off and was not
at home for eight months. Towards the end of the ninth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
month the king returned from his progress through his
country, and was already hard by his capital city, when, as
he journeyed over an uninhabited plain during the most
scorching heat of summer, he felt such excessive thirst that
he sent his servants round about to see if they could find
water anywhere and let him know of it at once. The
servants dispersed in various directions, sought in vain for a
whole hour, and returned without success to the king. The
thirst-tormented king proceeded to traverse the whole plain
far and wide himself, not believing that there was not a
spring somewhere or other; on he rode, and on a level spot,
on which there had not previously been any water, he espied
a well with a new wooden fence round it, full to the brim
with spring water, in the midst of which floated a silver cup
with a golden handle. The king sprang from his horse and
reached after the cup with his right hand; but the cup, just
as if it were alive and had eyes, darted quickly on one side
and floated again by itself. The king knelt down and began
to try to catch it, now with his right hand, now with his
left, but it moved and dodged away in such a manner that,
not being able to seize it with one hand, he tried to catch it
with both. But scarcely had he reached out with both
hands when the cup dived like a fish, and floated again on
the surface. &lsquo;Hang it!&rsquo; thought the king, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help
myself with the cup, I&rsquo;ll manage without it.&rsquo; He then bent
down to the water, which was as clear as crystal and as cold
as ice, and began in his thirst to drink. Meanwhile his long
beard, which reached down to his girdle, dipped into the
water. When he had quenched his thirst, he wanted to get
up again&mdash;something was holding his beard and wouldn&rsquo;t
let it go. He pulled once and again, but it was of no use;
he cried out therefore in anger, &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there? let go!&rsquo; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
I, the subterranean king, immortal Bony, and I shall not
let go till you give me that which you left unknowingly at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
home, and which you do not expect to find on your return.&rsquo;
The king looked into the depth of the well, and there was a
huge head like a tub, with green eyes and a mouth from ear
to ear, which was holding the king by the beard with extended
claws like those of a crab, and was laughing
mischievously. The king thought that a thing of which he
had not known before starting, and which he did not expect
on his return, could not be of great value, so he said to the
apparition, &lsquo;I give it.&rsquo; The apparition burst with laughter
and vanished with a flash of fire, and with it vanished also
the well, the water, the wooden fence, and the cup; and the
king was again on a hillock by a little wood kneeling on dry
sand, and there was nothing more. The king got up, crossed
himself, sprang on his horse, hastened to his attendants, and
rode on.</p>

<p>In a week or maybe a fortnight the king arrived at his
capital; the people came out in crowds to meet him; he
went in procession to the great court of the palace and
entered the corridor. In the corridor stood the queen
awaiting him, and holding close to her bosom a cushion, on
which lay a child, beautiful as the moon, kicking in swaddling
clothes. The king recollected himself, sighed painfully,
and said within himself: &lsquo;This is what I left without
knowing and found without expecting!&rsquo; And bitterly,
bitterly did he weep. All marvelled, but nobody dared to
ask the cause. The king took his son, without saying a
word, in his arms, gazed long on his innocent face; carried
him into the palace himself, laid him in the cradle, and,
suppressing his sorrow, devoted himself to the government
of his realm, but was never again cheerful as formerly, since
he was perpetually tormented by the thought that some day
Bony would claim his son.</p>

<p>Meanwhile weeks, months, and years flowed on, and no
one came for his son. The prince, named &lsquo;Unexpected,&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
grew and developed, and eventually became a handsome
youth. The king also in course of time regained his usual
cheerfulness; and forgot what had taken place, but alas!
everybody did not forget so easily.</p>

<p>Once the prince, while hunting in a forest, became
separated from his suite and found himself in a savage
wilderness. Suddenly there appeared before him a hideous
old man with green eyes, who said: &lsquo;How do you do,
Prince Unexpected? You have made me wait for you a
long time.&rsquo; &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; &lsquo;That you will find out hereafter,
but now, when you return to your father, greet him
from me, and tell him that I should be glad if he would
close accounts with me, for if he doesn&rsquo;t soon get out of
my debt of himself, he will repent it bitterly.&rsquo; After saying
this the hideous old man disappeared, and the prince in
amazement turned his horse, rode home and told the king
his adventure. The king turned as pale as a sheet, and revealed
the frightful secret to his son. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, father!&rsquo;
replied the prince, &lsquo;it isn&rsquo;t a great misfortune! I shall
manage to force Bony to renounce the right over me, which
he tricked you out of in so underhand a manner, and if in
the course of a year I do not return, it will be a token that
we shall see each other no more.&rsquo; The prince prepared for
his journey, the king gave him a suit of steel armour, a
sword, and a horse, and the queen hung round his neck a
cross of pure gold. At leave-taking they embraced affectionately,
wept heartily, and the prince rode off.</p>

<p>On he rode one day, two days, three days, and at the end
of the fourth day at the setting of the sun he came to the
shore of the sea, and in the self-same bay espied twelve
dresses, white as snow, though in the water, as far as the eye
could reach, there was no living soul to be seen; only
twelve white geese were swimming at a distance from the
shore. Curious to know to whom they belonged, he took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
one of the dresses, let his horse loose in a meadow, concealed
himself in a neighbouring thicket, and waited to see
what would come to pass. Thereupon the geese, after disporting
themselves on the sea, swam to the shore; eleven of
them went to the dresses, each threw herself on the ground
and became a beautiful damsel, dressed herself with speed,
and flew away into the plain. The twelfth goose, the last
and prettiest of all, did not venture to come out on the
shore, but only wistfully stretched out her neck, looking on
all sides. On seeing the prince she called out with a human
voice: &lsquo;Prince Unexpected, give me my dress; I will be
grateful to you in return.&rsquo; The prince hearkened to her,
placed the dress on the grass, and modestly turned away in
another direction. The goose came out on the grass,
changed herself into a damsel, dressed herself hastily, and
stood before the prince; she was young and more beautiful
than eye had seen or ear heard of. Blushing, she gave him
her white hand, and, casting her eyes down, said with a
pleasing voice: &lsquo;I thank you, good prince, for hearkening
to me: I am the youngest daughter of immortal Bony; he
has twelve young daughters, and rules in the subterranean
realm. My father, prince, has long been expecting you and
is very angry; however, don&rsquo;t grieve, and don&rsquo;t be frightened,
but do as I tell you. As soon as you see King Bony, fall at
once on your knees, and, paying no regard to his outcry,
upbraiding, and threats, approach him boldly. What will
happen afterwards you will learn, but now we must part.&rsquo;
On saying this the princess stamped on the ground with her
little foot; the ground sprang open at once, and they
descended into the subterranean realm, right into Bony&rsquo;s
palace, which shone all underground brighter than our sun.
The prince stepped boldly into the reception-room. Bony
was sitting on a golden throne with a glittering crown on his
head; his eyes gleamed like two saucers of green glass and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
his hands were like the nippers of a crab. As soon as he
espied him at a distance, the prince fell on his knees, and
Bony yelled so horribly that the vaults of the subterranean
dominion quaked; but the prince boldly moved on his knees
towards the throne, and, when he was only a few paces from
it, the king smiled and said: &lsquo;Thou hast marvellous luck in
succeeding in making me smile; remain in our subterranean
realm, but before thou becomest a true citizen thereof thou
art bound to execute three commands of mine; but because
it is late to-day, we will begin to-morrow; meanwhile go to
thy room.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The prince slept comfortably in the room assigned to him,
and early on the morrow Bony summoned him and said:
&lsquo;We will see, prince, what thou canst do. In the course of
the following night build me a palace of pure marble; let
the windows be of crystal, the roof of gold, an elegant
garden round about it, and in the garden seats and
fountains; if thou buildest it, thou wilt gain thyself my
love; if not, I shall command thy head to be cut off.&rsquo;
The prince heard it, returned to his apartment, and was
sitting mournfully thinking of the death that threatened him,
when outside at the window a bee came buzzing and said:
&lsquo;Let me in!&rsquo; He opened the lattice, in flew the bee, and
the princess, Bony&rsquo;s youngest daughter, appeared before the
wondering prince. &lsquo;What are you thus thinking about,
Prince Unexpected?&rsquo; &lsquo;Alas! I am thinking that your
father wishes to deprive me of life.&rsquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid! lie down
to sleep, and when you get up to-morrow morning your
palace will be ready.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So, too, it came to pass. At dawn the prince came out
of his room and espied a more beautiful palace than he had
ever seen, and Bony, when he saw it, wondered, and wouldn&rsquo;t
believe his own eyes. &lsquo;Well! thou hast won this time, and
now thou hast my second command. I shall place my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
twelve daughters before thee to-morrow; if thou dost not
guess which of them is the youngest, thou wilt place thy
head beneath the axe.&rsquo; &lsquo;I unable to recognise the youngest
princess!&rsquo; said the prince in his room; &lsquo;what difficulty can
there be in that?&rsquo; &lsquo;This,&rsquo; answered the princess, flying
into the room in the shape of a bee, &lsquo;that if I don&rsquo;t help
you, you won&rsquo;t recognise me, for we are all so alike that
even our father only distinguishes us by our dress.&rsquo; &lsquo;What
am I to do?&rsquo; &lsquo;What, indeed! That will be the youngest
over whose right eye you espy a ladycow; only look well.
Adieu!&rsquo; On the morrow King Bony again summoned
Prince Unexpected. The princesses stood in a row side by
side, all dressed alike and with eyes cast down. The prince
looked and marvelled how alike all the princesses were; he
went past them once, twice&mdash;he did not find the appointed
token; the third time he saw a ladycow over the eyebrow of
one, and cried out: &lsquo;This is the youngest princess!&rsquo; &lsquo;How
the deuce have you guessed it?&rsquo; said Bony angrily. &lsquo;There
must be some trickery here. I must deal with your lordship
differently. In three hours you will come here again,
and will show your cleverness in my presence. I shall light
a straw, and you will stitch a pair of boots before it goes out,
and if you don&rsquo;t do it you will perish.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The prince returned desponding and found the bee
already in his apartment. &lsquo;Why pensive again, prince?&rsquo;
&lsquo;How shouldn&rsquo;t I be pensive, when your father wants me
to stitch him a pair of boots, for what sort of cobbler am I?&rsquo;
&lsquo;What else will you do?&rsquo; &lsquo;What am I to do? I shan&rsquo;t
stitch the boots, and I&rsquo;m not afraid of death&mdash;one can but
die once!&rsquo; &lsquo;No, prince, you shall not die! I will
endeavour to rescue you, and we will either escape together
or perish together! We must flee&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing else to
be done.&rsquo; Saying this, the princess spat on one of the
window-panes, and the spittle immediately froze. She then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
went out of the room with the prince, locked the door after
her, and threw the key far away; then, taking each other
by the hands, they ascended rapidly, and in a moment
found themselves on the very spot whence they had descended
into the subterranean realm; there was the self-same
sea, the self-same shore overgrown with rushes and
thornbushes, the self-same fresh meadow, and in the meadow
cantered the prince&rsquo;s well-fed horse, who, as soon as he
descried his rider, came galloping straight to him. The
prince didn&rsquo;t stop long to think, but sprang on his horse,
the princess seated herself behind him, and off they set as
swift as an arrow.</p>

<p>King Bony at the appointed hour did not wait for Prince
Unexpected, but sent to ask him why he did not appear.
Finding the door locked, the servants knocked at it vigorously,
and the spittle answered them from the middle of the
room in the prince&rsquo;s voice, &lsquo;Anon!&rsquo; The servants carried
this answer to the king; he waited, waited, no prince; he
therefore again sent the same servants, who heard the same
answer: &lsquo;Anon!&rsquo; and carried what they had heard to the
king. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s this? Does he mean to make fun of me?&rsquo;
shouted the king in wrath: &lsquo;Go at once, break the door
open and conduct him to me!&rsquo; The servants hurried off,
broke open the door, and rushed in. What, indeed? there
was nobody there, and the spittle on the pane of glass was
splitting with laughter at them. Bony all but burst with
rage, and ordered them all to start off in pursuit of the
prince, threatening them with death if they returned empty-handed.
They sprang on horseback and hastened away
after the prince and princess.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Prince Unexpected and the princess, Bony&rsquo;s
daughter, were hurrying away on their spirited horse, and
amidst their rapid flight heard &lsquo;tramp, tramp,&rsquo; behind them.
The prince sprang from the horse, put his ear to the ground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
and said, &lsquo;They are pursuing us.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the princess,
&lsquo;we have no time to lose.&rsquo; Instantly she transformed
herself into a river, changed the prince into a bridge, the
horse into a raven, and the grand highway beyond the
bridge divided into three roads. Swiftly on the fresh track
hastened the pursuers, came on to the bridge, and stood
stupefied; they saw the track up to the bridge, but beyond
it disappeared, and the highway divided into three roads.
There was nothing to be done but to return, and they came
with nought. Bony shouted with rage, and cried out: &lsquo;A
bridge and a river! It was they. How was it that ye did not
guess it? Back, and don&rsquo;t return without them!&rsquo; The
pursuers recommenced the pursuit.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I hear &ldquo;tramp, tramp!&rdquo;&rsquo; whispered the princess, Bony&rsquo;s
daughter, affrightedly to Prince Unexpected, who sprang
from the saddle, put his ear to the ground, and replied:
&lsquo;They are making haste, and are not far off.&rsquo; That instant
the princess and prince, and with them also their horse,
became a gloomy forest, in which were roads, by-roads, and
footpaths without number, and on one of them it seemed
that two riders were hastening on a horse. Following the
fresh track, the pursuers came up to the forest, and when
they espied the fugitives in it, they hastened speedily after
them. On and on hurried the pursuers, seeing continually
before them a thick forest, a wide road and the fugitives on
it; now, now they thought to overtake them, when the
fugitives and the thick forest suddenly vanished, and they
found themselves at the self-same place whence they had
started in pursuit. They returned, therefore, again to
Bony empty-handed. &lsquo;A horse, a horse! I&rsquo;ll go myself!
they won&rsquo;t escape out of <em>my</em> hands!&rsquo; yelled Bony, foaming
at the mouth, and started in pursuit.</p>

<p>Again the princess said to Prince Unexpected: &lsquo;Methinks
they are pursuing us, and this time it is Bony, my father,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
himself, but the first church is the boundary of his dominion,
and he won&rsquo;t be able to pursue us further. Give me your
golden cross.&rsquo; The prince took off his affectionate mother&rsquo;s
gift and gave it to the princess, and in a moment she was
transformed into a church, he into the priest, and the horse
into the bell; and that instant up came Bony. &lsquo;Monk!&rsquo;
Bony asked the priest, &lsquo;hast thou not seen some travellers
on horseback?&rsquo; &lsquo;Only just now Prince Unexpected rode
this way with the princess, Bony&rsquo;s daughter. They came
into the church, performed their devotions, gave money for
a mass for your good health, and ordered me to present
their respects to you if you should ride this way.&rsquo; Bony, too,
returned empty-handed. But Prince Unexpected rode on
with the princess, Bony&rsquo;s daughter, in no further fear of
pursuit.</p>

<p>They rode gently on, when they saw before them a
beautiful town, into which the prince felt an irresistible
longing to go. &lsquo;Prince,&rsquo; said the princess, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t go; my
heart forebodes misfortune there.&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll only ride there for a
short time, and look round the town, and we&rsquo;ll then proceed
on our journey.&rsquo; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s easy enough to ride thither, but will it
be as easy to return? Nevertheless, as you absolutely
desire it, go, and I will remain here in the form of a white
stone till you return; be circumspect, my beloved; the
king, the queen, and the princess, their daughter, will come
out to meet you, and with them will be a beautiful little boy&mdash;don&rsquo;t
kiss him, for, if you do, you will forget me at once,
and will never set eyes on me more in the world&mdash;I shall
die of despair. I will wait for you here on the road for
three days, and if on the third day you don&rsquo;t return, remember
that I perish, and perish all through you.&rsquo; The
prince took leave and rode to the town, and the princess
transformed herself into a white stone, and remained on the
road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
One day passed, a second passed, the third also passed,
and nothing was seen of the prince. Poor princess! He
had not obeyed her counsel; in the town, the king, the
queen, and the princess their daughter, had come out to
meet him, and with them walked a little boy, a curly-headed
chatterbox, with eyes as bright as stars. The child rushed
straight into the prince&rsquo;s arms, who was so captivated by the
beauty of the lad that he forgot everything, and kissed the
child affectionately. That moment his memory was darkened,
and he utterly forgot the princess, Bony&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

<p>The princess lay as a white stone by the wayside, one
day, two days, and when the third day passed and the prince
did not return from the town, she transformed herself into
a cornflower, and sprang in among the rye by the roadside.
&lsquo;Here I shall stay by the roadside; maybe some passer-by
will pull me up or trample me into the ground,&rsquo; said she,
and tears like dew-drops glittered on the azure petals. Just
then an old man came along the road, espied the cornflower
in the rye by the wayside, was captivated by its
beauty, extracted it carefully from the ground, carried it into
his dwelling, set it in a flower-pot, watered it, and began to
tend it attentively. But&mdash;O marvel!&mdash;ever since the time
that the cornflower was brought into his dwelling, all kind
of wonders began to happen in it. Scarcely was the old
man awake, when everything in the house was already set
in order, nowhere was the least atom of dust remaining. At
noon he came home&mdash;dinner was all ready, the table set; he
had but to sit down and eat as much as he wanted. The
old man wondered and wondered, till at last terror took
possession of him, and he betook himself for advice to an
old witch of his acquaintance in the neighbourhood. &lsquo;Do
this,&rsquo; the witch advised him: &lsquo;get up before the first morning
dawn, before the cocks crow to announce daylight, and
notice diligently what begins to stir first in the house, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
that which does stir, cover with this napkin: what will
happen further, you will see.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The old man didn&rsquo;t close his eyes the whole night, and as
soon as the first gleam appeared and things began to be
visible in the house, he saw how the cornflower suddenly
moved in the flower-pot, sprang out, and began to stir about
the room; when simultaneously everything began to put
itself in its place; the dust began to sweep itself clean away,
and the fire kindled itself in the stove. The old man
sprang cleverly out of his bed and placed the cloth on the
flower as it endeavoured to escape, when lo! the flower
became a beautiful damsel&mdash;the princess, Bony&rsquo;s daughter.
&lsquo;What have you done?&rsquo; cried the princess. &lsquo;Why have
you brought life back again to me? My betrothed, Prince
Unexpected, has forgotten me, and, therefore, life has
become distasteful to me.&rsquo; &lsquo;Your betrothed, Prince
Unexpected, is going to be married to-day; the wedding
feast is ready, and the guests are beginning to assemble.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The princess wept, but after awhile dried her tears, dressed
herself in frieze, and went into the town like a village girl.
She came to the royal kitchen, where there was great noise
and bustle. She went up to the clerk of the kitchen with
humble and attractive grace, and said in a sweet voice:
&lsquo;Dear sir, do me one favour; allow me to make a wedding-cake
for Prince Unexpected.&rsquo; Occupied with work, the
first impulse of the clerk of the kitchen was to give the girl
a rebuff, but when he looked at her, the words died on his
lips, and he answered kindly: &lsquo;Ah, my beauty of beauties!
do what you will; I will hand the prince your cake myself.&rsquo;
The cake was soon baked, and all the invited guests were
sitting at table. The clerk of the kitchen himself placed a
huge cake on a silver dish before the prince; but scarce had
the prince made a cut in the side of it, when lo! an unheard-of
marvel displayed itself in the presence of all. A gray
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
tom-pigeon and a white hen-pigeon came out of the cake;
the tom-pigeon walked along the table, and the hen-pigeon
walked after him, cooing:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&lsquo;Stay, stay, my pigeonet, oh stay!</div>
<div class="i0">Don&rsquo;t from thy true love flee away;</div>
<div class="i0">My faithless lover I pursue,</div>
<div class="i0">Prince Unexpected like unto,</div>
<div class="i0">Who Bony&rsquo;s daughter did betray.&rsquo;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Scarcely had Prince Unexpected heard this cooing of the
pigeon, when he regained his lost recollection, bounced from
the table, rushed to the door, and behind the door the
princess, Bony&rsquo;s daughter, took him by the hand; they went
together down the corridor, and before them stood a horse
saddled and bridled.</p>

<p>Why delay? Prince Unexpected and the princess,
Bony&rsquo;s daughter, sprang on the horse, started on the road,
and at last arrived happily in the realm of Prince Unexpected&rsquo;s
father. The king and queen received them with
joy and merriment, and didn&rsquo;t wait long before they prepared
them a magnificent wedding, the like of which eye
never saw and ear never heard of.</p>

<hr class="rule" />

<p>With the above story should be compared that of &lsquo;The
Water King, and Vasilissa the Wise&rsquo; (Ralston, p. 120). A
large number of tales that may also be compared with it are
mentioned by Mr. Ralston in pp. 132-133 of his Russian
Folk-tales. As to the interpretation of &lsquo;Prince Unexpected,&rsquo;
it is very tempting to look upon Kostchey&rsquo;s twelve daughters
as representing the twelve months. And, as the year
anciently began with spring, Kostchey&rsquo;s youngest daughter
would be the month which forms the transition from
winter to spring. The interruption of their progress by
Prince Unexpected&rsquo;s temporary forgetfulness may be explained
as the temporary cessation of warm weather and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
return of a kind of secondary winter, which often occurs in
early spring. Prince Unexpected himself may, perhaps, be
considered as representing the sun, who has been held in
captivity by the winter and has escaped with the last month
of the year. Vasilissa the Wise is the <em>eldest</em> daughter of
the Water King, and would thus represent the first month
of the new year.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap18" id="chap18"></a>XVIII.&mdash;THE SPIRIT OF A BURIED MAN.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A poor</span> scholar was going by the highway into a town, and
found under the walls of the gate the body of a dead
man, unburied, trodden by the feet of the passers-by. He
had not much in his purse, but willingly gave enough to
bury him, that he might not be spat upon and have sticks
thrown at him. He performed his devotions over the fresh
heaped-up grave, and went on into the world to wander. In
an oak wood sleep overpowered him, and when he awoke,
he espied with wonderment a bag full of gold. He thanked
the unseen beneficent hand, and came to the bank of a
large river, where it was necessary to be ferried over. The
two ferrymen, observing the bag full of gold, took him into
the boat, and just at an eddy took from him the gold and
threw him into the water. As the waves carried him away
insensible, he by accident clutched a plank, and by its aid
floated successfully to the shore. It was not a plank, but
the spirit of the buried man, who addressed him in these
words: &lsquo;You honoured my remains by burial; I thank
you for it. In token of gratitude I will teach you how you
can transform yourself into a crow, into a hare, and into a
deer.&rsquo; Then he taught him the spell. The scholar, when
acquainted with the spell, could with ease transform himself
into a crow, into a hare, and into a deer. He wandered far,
he wandered wide, till he wandered to the court of a mighty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
king, where he remained as an archer in attendance at the
court. This king had a beautiful daughter, but she dwelt
on an inaccessible island, surrounded on all sides by the
sea. She dwelt in a castle of copper, and possessed a sword
such that he who brandished it could conquer the largest
army. Enemies had invaded the territory of the king; he
needed and desired the victorious sword. But how to
obtain it, when nobody had up to that time succeeded in
getting on to the lonely island? He therefore made proclamation
that whoever should bring the victorious sword
from the princess should obtain her hand, and, moreover,
should sit upon the throne after him. No one was venturesome
enough to attempt it, till the wandering scholar, then
an archer attached to the court, stood before the king
announcing his readiness to go, and requesting a letter, that
on receipt of that token the princess might give up the weapon
to him. All men were astonished, and the king entrusted
him with a letter to his daughter. He went into the forest,
without knowing in the least that another archer attached
to the court was dogging his steps. He first transformed
himself into a hare, then into a deer, and darted off with
haste and speed; he traversed no small distance, till he
stood on the shore of the sea. He then transformed himself
into a crow, flew across the water of the sea, and didn&rsquo;t rest
till he was on the island. He went into the castle of copper,
delivered to the beautiful princess the letter from her father,
and requested her to give him the victorious sword. The
beautiful princess looked at the archer. He captured her
heart at once. She asked inquisitively how he had been
able to get to her castle, which was on all sides surrounded
by water and knew no human footsteps. Thereupon the
archer replied that he knew secret spells by which he
could transform himself into a deer, a hare, and a crow.
The beautiful princess, therefore, requested the archer to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
transform himself into a deer before her eyes. When he
made himself into a graceful deer, and began to fawn and
bound, the princess secretly pulled a tuft of fur from his
back. When he transformed himself again into a hare, and
bounded with pricked up ears, the princess secretly pulled
a little fur off his back. When he changed himself into a
crow and began to fly about in the room, the princess
secretly pulled a few feathers from the bird&rsquo;s wings. She
immediately wrote a letter to her father and delivered
up the victorious sword. The young scholar flew across
the sea in the form of a crow, then ran a great distance in
that of a deer, till in the neighbourhood of the wood he
bounded as a hare. The treacherous archer was already
there in ambush, saw when he changed himself into
a hare, and recognised him at once. He drew his bow,
let fly the arrow, and killed the hare. He took from him
the letter and carried off the sword, went to the castle,
delivered to the king the letter and the sword of victory,
and demanded at once the fulfilment of the promise that
had been made. The king, transported with joy, promised
him immediately his daughter&rsquo;s hand, mounted his horse,
and rode boldly against his enemies with the sword.
Scarcely had he espied their standards, when he brandished
the sword mightily several times, and that towards the four
quarters of the world. At every wave of the sword large
masses of enemies fell dead on the spot, and others, seized
with panic, fled like hares. The king returned joyful with
victory, and sent for his beautiful daughter, to give her to
wife to the archer who brought the sword. A banquet
was prepared. The musicians were already striking up,
the whole castle was brilliantly lighted; but the princess
sat sorrowful beside the assassin-archer. She knew at once
that he was in nowise the man whom she saw in the castle
on the island, but she dared not ask her father where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
other handsome archer was; she only wept much and
secretly: her heart beat for the other.</p>

<p>The poor scholar, in the hare&rsquo;s skin, lay slain under the
oak, lay there a whole year, till one night he felt himself
awakened from a mighty sleep, and before him stood the
well-known spirit, whose body he had buried. He told him
what had happened to him, brought him back to life, and
said: &lsquo;To-morrow is the princess&rsquo;s wedding; hasten,
therefore, to the castle without a moment&rsquo;s delay; she will
recognise you; the archer, too, who killed you treacherously,
will recognise you.&rsquo; The young man sprang up promptly,
went to the castle with throbbing heart, and entered the grand
saloon, where numerous guests were eating and drinking.
The beautiful princess recognised him at once, shrieked
with joy, and fainted; and the assassin-archer, the moment
he set eyes on him, turned pale and green from fear. Then
the young man related the treason and murderous act of the
archer, and in order to prove his words, turned himself in
presence of all the assembled company into a graceful deer,
and began to fawn upon the princess. She placed the
tuft of fur pulled off him in the castle on the back of the
deer, and the fur immediately grew into its place. Again
he transformed himself into a hare, and similarly the piece
of fur pulled off, which the princess had kept, grew
into its place immediately on contact. All looked on in
astonishment till the young man changed himself into a
crow. The princess brought out the feathers which she
had pulled from its wings in the castle, and the feathers
immediately grew into their places. Then the old king
commanded the assassin-archer to be put to death. Four
horses were led out, all wild and unbroken. He was bound
to them by his hands and feet, the horses were started off
by the whip, and at one bound they tore the assassin-archer
to pieces. The young man obtained the hand of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
the young and charming princess. The whole castle was
in a brilliant blaze of light, they drank, they ate with mirth;
and the princess did not weep, for she possessed the
husband that she wished for.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap19" id="chap19"></a>XIX.&mdash;THE PALE MAIDEN.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A peasant</span> farmer in reduced circumstances had a beautiful
daughter, whom an old knight, the proprietor of the village,
wanted to marry, and that even by compulsion. But the
damsel disliked him, and her parents also refused to consent
to the marriage. So the proprietor persecuted them in
every way in his power, and so oppressed them with forced
labour and ordered them to be beaten on the slightest
occasion, that the poor farmer could hold out no longer,
but determined to remove from the village with his whole
family. In the cottage in which the farmer dwelt there
was something continually grating behind the stove, but
though they searched several times, and turned the seat
constructed at the side of the stove upside down, yet were
they unable to discover aught. But when, on the day of
their departure, they were removing the rest of their goods,
they heard a more and more articulate grating, and whilst
they were impatiently listening, as the grating and scraping
went on, out of the stove sprang a thin pale form, like a
buried maiden. &lsquo;What the devil is this?&rsquo; cried the father.
&lsquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rsquo; screamed the mother, and all the
children after her. &lsquo;I am no devil,&rsquo; said the thin pale
maiden, &lsquo;but I am your Poverty. You are now taking yourselves
off hence, and you are bound to take me with you to
your new abode.&rsquo; The poor householder was no fool; he
bethought himself a little, and neither seized nor throttled
his Poverty, for she was so slight that he could have done
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
nothing of any consequence to her, but he made the lowest
possible reverence to her, and said: &lsquo;Well, your gracious
ladyship, if you are so well satisfied amongst us, then come
with us; but, as you see, we are removing everything for
ourselves, so help us to carry something, and we shall get off
the quicker.&rsquo; Poverty agreed to this, and wanted to take a
couple of small vessels out of the house, but the householder
distributed the small vessels among his children to
remove, and said that there was still a block of wood in the
yard which must also be taken away. Going out into the
yard, he made a cut in the block from above with his axe. He
then called Poverty, and politely requested her to help him
remove the block. Poverty did not see on which side to
lift the block, till, when the farmer pointed out the cleft to
her, she put her long thin fingers in the chink. The farmer,
pretending to lift the block on the other side, suddenly
pulled his axe out of the cleft, and Poverty&rsquo;s long thin
fingers remained squeezed in the block, so that, being
utterly unable to pull them out, she shrieked out immediately
in what pain she was. But all in vain. The farmer removed
all his goods as well as his children, quitted the cottage
completely, and returned to the place no more.</p>

<p>When the farmer settled in another village, things went
with him so prosperously that ere long he was the richest
man in the whole village; he married his daughter to a
respectable and wealthy farmer&rsquo;s son, twenty years old, and
the whole family prospered. On the other hand, the proprietor
of the first village, the oppressor of these poor
people, having to assign vacant cottages to fresh tenants,
came to inspect the cottage left vacant by the reduced
farmer, who had refused to give him his daughter. Seeing
Poverty beside the block complaining of the pain of her
fingers, he took pity on the pale maiden, took her fingers
out by means of a wedge, and set her completely free.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
From the time of her liberation the pale maiden never
quitted the side of her liberator, and when, moreover, the
devil lit a fire in the old stove, and the proprietor went dotty
with love in his old age, he spent and spent, and ran through
everything that he had.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap20" id="chap20"></a>XX.&mdash;THE PLAGUE-SWARM.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A Ruthenian</span>, having lost his wife and children by the
plague, fled into the forest from his desolate cottage and
sought safety there. He wandered about all day long;
towards evening he constructed a booth of branches, lit a
little fire, and fell asleep, wearied out. It was already after
midnight when a mighty noise awoke him. He rose to his
feet, listened, and heard a kind of songs in the distance,
and accompanying the songs a sound of tambourines and
fifes. He listened, in no small astonishment, that, when
death was raging around, people were rejoicing there so
merrily. The noise that he heard kept continually approaching,
and the terrified Podolian<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> espied a swarming multitude
advancing along a wide road. It was a troop of strange-looking
spectres that circled round a carriage; the carriage
was black and elevated, and in it sat the Plague. At every
step the frightful company kept increasing; for on the road
almost everything was transformed into a spectre.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_8_8">[8]</a></span>
A Ruthenian by nationality, a Podolian by locality.</p>
</div>

<p>Feebly burned his little fire; a tolerably large firebrand
was still smoking a little. Scarcely had the plague-swarm
drawn near when the firebrand stood upon feet, extended
two arms&mdash;the burning part began to glitter with two
glaring eyes&mdash;it began to sing in concert with the others.
The villager was stupefied; in speechless terror he seized
his axe and was on the point of striking the nearest spectre,
but the axe flew out of his hands, transformed itself into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
tall woman with raven-black tresses, and, singing, vanished
before his eyes. The plague-swarm proceeded onwards; and
the Podolian saw how the trees, the bushes, the owls, the
screech-owls, assuming tall shapes, increased the multitude,
the terrible harbinger of a frightful death. He fell down
powerless, and when in the morning the warmth of the sun
awoke him, the vessels that he had brought with him were
smashed and broken, the clothes torn to rags, the provisions
spoilt. He perceived that no one but the plague-swarm had
done him all this mischief, and, thanking God that he had
at any rate escaped with life, proceeded further to seek
shelter and food.</p>

<h3><a name="part02a" id="part02a"></a><i>WHITE RUSSIAN STORIES.</i></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>E now come to the first set of stories belonging to
those Slavonians who make use of the Cyrillic
instead of the Latin characters. The White Russians occupy
the whole of the Governments of Minsk and Mogilef, and
great part of those of Vitebsk and Grodno. In these stories
we first met with the distinction between the Western and
Eastern Slavonic terms for monarch. The Western Slavonians
employ the terms <i>kral</i>, <i>krul</i>, or <i>korol</i>, for a monarch, which
are believed to originate from the name of the mighty
Frankish monarch, <span class="smcap">Karl</span> the Great, whom we generally
know by his French title, Charlemagne. The Eastern
Slavonians usually make use of the term <span class="smcap">Tzar</span>, &lsquo;Emperor,&rsquo;
which is a corruption of the Latin &lsquo;C&aelig;sar,&rsquo; the title of the
emperors of Constantinople, and later of the Russian
emperors. Thus in the following stories we shall find
emperors and empresses generally, though not invariably,
replacing kings and queens, till we return again to the
West.</p>

<p>The White Russian language possesses but little literature,
but was employed for diplomatic purposes by the once
powerful state of Lithuania (Morfill&rsquo;s &lsquo;Slavonic Literature,&rsquo;
S.P.C.K., p. 113).</p>

<p>The heroes &lsquo;Overturn-hill&rsquo; (<i>Vertogor</i>) and &lsquo;Overturn-oak&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
(<i>Vertodub</i>), who appear in <a href="#chap22">No. 22</a>, occur also in a story from
the Ukraine, given by Mr. Ralston (pp. 170-175). Several
circumstances in <a href="#chap22">No. 22</a> are also similar to incidents in the
Russian tale of &lsquo;Ivan Popyalof&rsquo; (Ralston, p. 66), but in
spite of these similarities the stories are truly distinct.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap21" id="chap21"></a>XXI.&mdash;THE FROST, THE SUN, AND THE WIND.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time a man went out alone, and met on the
road the Sun, the Frost, and the Wind. Well, on meeting
them, he gave them a salutation: &lsquo;Praised&rsquo; [be the Lord
Jesus Christ]! To which did he present the salutation?
The Sun said: &lsquo;To me, that I might not burn him.&rsquo; The
Frost said: &lsquo;To me, and not to you, for he is not so much
afraid of you as of me.&rsquo; &lsquo;Story-tellers! it&rsquo;s false!&rsquo; said,
lastly, the Wind; &lsquo;that man presented the salutation not to
you two, but to me.&rsquo; They began to jangle and quarrel
together, and all but pulled the mantles off each other&rsquo;s
backs. &lsquo;Well, if it&rsquo;s so, let&rsquo;s ask him to whom he presented
the salutation, to me or to you?&rsquo; They overtook the man
and asked him; then he said: &lsquo;To the Wind.&rsquo; &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I
say that it was to me?&rsquo; &lsquo;Stop you! I&rsquo;ll give you a baking,
you rascal!&rsquo; said the Sun; &lsquo;you shall remember me.&rsquo; Then
said the Wind: &lsquo;Never fear, he won&rsquo;t bake you; I shall
blow and cool him.&rsquo; &lsquo;So will I freeze you up, you scoundrel!&rsquo;
said the Frost. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, poor fellow!
then I shan&rsquo;t blow, and he&rsquo;ll do nothing to you; he doesn&rsquo;t
freeze you up without a wind.&rsquo;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap22" id="chap22"></a>XXII.&mdash;LITTLE ROLLING-PEA.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a certain empire and a certain province, on the ocean
sea, on the island of Bujan, stood a green oak, and under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
the oak a roasted ox, and by its side a whetted knife; suddenly
the knife was seized. Be so good as to eat! This
isn&rsquo;t a story (<i>kazka</i>), but only a preface to a story (<i>prikazka</i>):
whoever shall listen to my story, may he have a sableskin
cloak, and a horseskin cloak, and a very beautiful damsel, a
hundred roubles for the wedding, and fifty for a jollification!</p>

<p>There was a husband and wife. The wife went for water,
took a bucket, and after drawing water, went home, and all
at once she saw a pea rolling along. She thought to herself:
&lsquo;This is the gift of God.&rsquo; She took it up and ate it, and in
course of time became the mother of a baby boy, who grew
not by years, but by hours, like millet dough when leavened.
They nursed and petted him in a way that couldn&rsquo;t be improved
upon, and put him to school. What others learnt in
three or four years he understood in a single year, and the
book was not sufficient for him. He came from the school to
his father and mother: &lsquo;Now, then, daddy and mammy,
thank my teachers, for already many come to school to me.
Thank God, I know more than they.&rsquo; Well, he went into
the street to amuse himself, and found a pin, which he
brought to his father and mother. He said to his father:
&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s this piece of iron; take it to a smith, and let him
make me a mace of seven poods weight.&rsquo; His father didn&rsquo;t
say a single word to him, but only thought in his own mind:
&lsquo;The Lord has given me a child different from other people;
I think he has a middling understanding, but he is now
making a fool of me. Can it possibly be that a seven-pood<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
mace can be made out of a pin?&rsquo; His father, having a considerable
sum of money in gold, silver, and paper, drove to
the town, bought seven poods of iron, and gave them to a
smith to make a mace of. They made him a seven-pood
mace, and he brought it home. Little Rolling-pea came out
from the attic, took his seven-pood mace, and, hearing a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
storm in the sky, threw it into the clouds. He went up into
his attic: &lsquo;Mother, look in my head before I start; a nasty
thing is biting me, for I am a young lad.&rsquo; ... Well, rising
from his mother&rsquo;s knees, he went out into the yard and saw
the clouds. He fell down with his right ear to the broad
ground, and on rising up called his father: &lsquo;Father, come
here: see what is whizzing and humming; my mace is coming
to the ground.&rsquo; He placed his knee in the way of his mace;
the mace struck him on the knee and broke in halves. He
became angry with his father: &lsquo;Well, father, why did you
not have a mace made for me out of the iron that I gave
you? If you had done so, it would not have broken, but
only bent. Here is the same iron for you, go and get it
made; don&rsquo;t add any of your own.&rsquo; The smiths put the
iron in the fire and began to beat it with hammers and pull
it, and made a seven-pood mace.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_9_9">[9]</a></span>
A pood is 40 Russian, 36 English, pounds.</p>
</div>

<p>Little Rolling-pea took his seven-pood mace and got ready
to go on a journey, a long journey; he went and went, and
Overturn-hill met him. &lsquo;I salute you, brother Little Rolling-pea!
whither are you going? whither are you journeying?&rsquo;
Little Rolling-pea also asked him a question: &lsquo;Who
are you?&rsquo; &lsquo;I am the mighty hero Overturn-hill.&rsquo; &lsquo;Will
you be my comrade?&rsquo; said Little Rolling-pea. He replied:
&lsquo;Possibly I will be at your service.&rsquo; They went on together.
They went and went, and the mighty hero Overturn-oak
met them. &lsquo;God bless you, brothers! Good health to
you! What manner of men are you?&rsquo; inquired Overturn-oak.
&lsquo;Little Rolling-pea and Overturn-hill.&rsquo; &lsquo;Whither are
you going?&rsquo; &lsquo;To such a city. A dragon devours people
there, so we are going to smite him.&rsquo; &lsquo;Is it not possible
for me to join your company?&rsquo; &lsquo;It is possible,&rsquo; said Little
Rolling-pea. They went to the city, and made themselves
known to the emperor. &lsquo;What manner of men are you?&rsquo;
&lsquo;We are mighty heroes!&rsquo; &lsquo;Is it in your power to deliver this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
city? A dragon is ravenous and destroys much people.
He must be slain.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why do we call ourselves mighty
heroes, if we do not slay him?&rsquo; Midnight came, and they
went up to a bridge of guelder-rosewood over a river of fire.
Lo! up came a six-headed dragon, and posted himself upon
the bridge, and immediately his horse neighed, his falcon
chattered, and his hound howled. He gave his horse a
blow on the head: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t neigh, devil&rsquo;s carrion!<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Don&rsquo;t
chatter, falcon! And you, hound, don&rsquo;t howl! For here
is Little Rolling-pea. Well now,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;come forth,
Little Rolling-pea! shall we fight or shall we try our strength?&rsquo;
Little Rolling-pea answered: &lsquo;Not to try their strength do
good youths travel, but only to fight.&rsquo; They began the
combat. Little Rolling-pea and his comrades struck the
dragon three blows at a time on three heads. The dragon,
seeing that he could not escape destruction, said: &lsquo;Well,
brothers, it is only little Rolling-pea that troubles me. I&rsquo;d
settle matters with you two.&rsquo; They began to fight again,
smashed the dragon&rsquo;s remaining heads, took the dragon&rsquo;s
horse to the stable, his falcon to the mews, and his hound
to the kennel; and Little Rolling-pea cut out the tongues
from all six heads, took and placed them in his knapsack,
and the headless trunk they cast into the river of fire. They
came to the emperor, and brought him the tongues as
certain proof. The emperor thanked them. &lsquo;I see that
you are mighty heroes and deliverers of the city, and all
the people. If you wish to drink and eat, take all manner
of beverages and eatables without money and without tax.&rsquo;
And from joy he issued a proclamation throughout the whole
town, that all the eating-houses, inns, and small public-houses
were to be open for the mighty heroes. Well, they went
everywhere, drank, amused themselves, refreshed themselves,
and enjoyed various honours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
Night came, and exactly at midnight they went under the
guelder-rose bridge to the river of fire, and speedily up came
a seven-headed dragon. Immediately his horse neighed, his
falcon chattered, and his hound howled. The dragon immediately
struck his horse on the head. &lsquo;Neigh not, devil&rsquo;s
carrion! chatter not, falcon! howl not, hound! for here is
Little Rolling-pea. Now then,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;come forth, Little
Rolling-pea! Shall we fight or try our strength?&rsquo; &lsquo;Good
youths travel not to try their strength, but only to fight.&rsquo;
And they began the combat, and the heroes beat off six of
the dragon&rsquo;s heads; the seventh remained. The dragon
said: &lsquo;Give me breathing time!&rsquo; But Little Rolling-pea said:
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t expect me to give you breathing time.&rsquo; They began
the combat again. He beat off the last head also, cut out
the tongues, and placed them in his knapsack, but threw the
trunk into the river of fire. They came to the emperor, and
brought the tongues for certain proof.</p>

<p>The third time they went at midnight to the bridge of
guelder-rose and the river of fire; speedily up came to them
a nine-headed dragon. Immediately his horse neighed, his
falcon chattered, and his hound howled. The dragon struck
his horse on the head. &lsquo;Neigh not, devil&rsquo;s carrion! falcon,
chatter not! hound, howl not! for here is Little Rolling-pea.
And now come forth, Little Rolling-pea! Shall we fight or
try our strength?&rsquo; Little Rolling-pea said: &lsquo;Not to try their
strength do good youths travel, but only to fight.&rsquo; They
began the combat, and the heroes beat off eight heads; the
ninth remained. Little Rolling-pea said: &lsquo;Give us breathing
time, unclean power!&rsquo; It answered: &lsquo;Take breathing time
or not, you will not overcome me; you slew my brothers by
craft, not by strength.&rsquo; Little Rolling-pea not only fought,
but thought how to delude the dragon. All at once he
thought of a plan, and said: &lsquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s still much of your
brother behind&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take you all.&rsquo; Hastily the dragon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
looked round, and he cut off the ninth head also, cut out
the tongues, put them into his knapsack, and threw the
trunk into the river of fire. They went to the emperor.
The emperor said: &lsquo;I thank you, mighty heroes! live with
God, and with joy and courage, and take as much gold,
silver, and paper money as you want.&rsquo;</p>

<p>After this the wives of the three dragons met together and
took counsel together. &lsquo;Whence did those men come who
slew our husbands? Well, we <em>shall</em> be women if we don&rsquo;t
get rid of them out of the world.&rsquo; The youngest said: &lsquo;Now
then, sisters! let us go by the highroad, where they will go.
I will make myself into a very beautiful wayside seat, and if,
when wearied, they sit down upon it, it will be death to
them all.&rsquo; The second said to her: &lsquo;If you do nothing to
them, I will make myself into an apple-tree beside the highroad,
and when they begin to come up to me, the agreeable
odour will attract them; and if they taste the apples, it will
be death to them all.&rsquo; Well, the heroes came up to the
beautiful wayside seat. Little Rolling-pea thrust his sword
into it up to the hilt&mdash;blood poured forth! They went on
to the apple-tree. &lsquo;Brother Little Rolling-pea,&rsquo; said the
heroes, &lsquo;let us each eat an apple.&rsquo; But he said: &lsquo;If it is
possible, let us eat; if it is not possible, let us go on further.&rsquo;
He drew his sword and thrust it into the apple-tree up to
the hilt, and blood poured forth immediately. The third
she-dragon hastened after them, and extended her jaws from
the earth to the sky. Little Rolling-pea saw that there was
not room for them to pass by. How were they to save
themselves? He looked about and saw that she specially
aimed at him, and threw the three horses into her mouth.
The she-dragon flew off to the blue sea to drink water, and
they proceeded further. She pursued them again. He saw
that she was near, and threw the three falcons into her
mouth. Again the she-dragon flew to the blue sea to drink
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
water, and they proceeded further. Little Rolling-pea looked
round; the she-dragon was again pursuing him, and seeing
his danger, he took and threw the three hounds into her
mouth. Again she flew off to the blue sea to drink water;
while she drank her fill, they proceeded still further. He
looked round and saw that she was catching them up again.
Little Rolling-pea took his two comrades and threw them
into her mouth. The she-dragon flew to the blue sea to
drink water, and he went on. Again she overtook him; he
looked round, saw that she was not far off, and said: &lsquo;Lord,
protect me and save my soul!&rsquo; He saw before him an iron
workshop, and fled into the smithy. The smith said to him:
&lsquo;Why, stranger, are you so cowardly?&rsquo; &lsquo;Honourable gentlemen!
protect me from an unclean power, and save my
soul!&rsquo; They took and shut the smithy completely up.
&lsquo;Give up to me what is mine!&rsquo; said the she-dragon. Then
the smiths said to her: &lsquo;Lick the iron door through, and we
will place him on your tongue.&rsquo; She licked the door through,
and placed her tongue in the centre. The smiths seized her
tongue three at a time with red-hot pincers, and said: &lsquo;Come,
stranger, do with her what you will!&rsquo; He went out into the
yard, and began to pound the she-dragon, and pounded her
skin to the bones, and her bones to the marrow; then took
her with her whole carcase and buried her seven fathoms
deep. Then, and not till then, did he live and eat morsels;
but we ate bread, for he had none. I was there, too, and
drank honey-wine; it flowed over my beard, but didn&rsquo;t get
into my mouth.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap23" id="chap23"></a>XXIII.&mdash;THE WONDERFUL BOYS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A father</span> had three daughters; they went to the river to
wash the linen. The king&rsquo;s son rode up. One said:
&lsquo;Well, if the king&rsquo;s son were to marry me, I would hem the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
whole palace round with a single needle.&rsquo; The second said:
&lsquo;If the king&rsquo;s son were to marry me, I would feed the whole
palace with a single roll.&rsquo; But the third said: &lsquo;If the
king&rsquo;s son were to marry me, I would bring him two sons,
each with a moon on his head and a star on the nape of his
neck.&rsquo; The king rode up to the one that said: &lsquo;I would
bring him two sons;&rsquo; they lived one year, two years, and
she was expecting to become a mother. The king came
and gave orders to her mother: &lsquo;Whatever God gives my
wife, let it be reared.&rsquo; He rode away twenty miles off, and
God gave his wife children; she brought him two sons,
each with a moon on his head and a star on the nape of
his neck. His wife wrote a letter, that God had given them
two sons, each with a moon on his head and a star on the
nape of his neck. A servant carried the letter to him, and
went in to stop the night at the house of the queen&rsquo;s sister,
without knowing that it was her sister. He lay down to sleep;
then she took and opened the letter, erased that which was
written in it&mdash;&lsquo;Each with a moon on his head and a star on
the nape of his neck&rsquo;&mdash;and wrote instead, that it was not a
snake nor a lizard&mdash;it was nobody knew what, that she had
become the mother of. The man went to the king and
delivered the letter. He read it through: &lsquo;What God has
given her, let it not be destroyed without my orders.&rsquo; He
went back and again stopped at the same place to pass the
night; she took the letter again, opened it, erased what the
king had written, and wrote instead, that before he returned,
she was to bury her sons. When he arrived, the king&rsquo;s wife
read it through, and began to weep; she was grieved to
bury those beautiful sons. She dug two graves in the yard
and buried them; out of them grew two maples, a golden
stem and a silver one. The king came to the house and
put her away because she had buried them without his
orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
He rode off and married his wife&rsquo;s second sister. They
lived together, and after a time she said: &lsquo;My most
illustrious husband! let us cut down those maples and
make ourselves a bed.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Ah! my most illustrious husband!
let us cut up that bed and burn it, and sprinkle the ashes on
the road.&rsquo; A shepherd was driving sheep that way; a
ewe strayed and swallowed some of the ashes; she bore two
he-lambs; on the head of each was a moon, on the back of
the neck a star. Then she disliked those lambs, ordered
them to be slaughtered, and the entrails to be thrown out
into the street. The first wife came out, collected the
entrails, cooked and ate them, and became the mother of
two sons; each had a moon on his head and a star on the
nape of his neck. The two sons grew and grew, and never
took off their caps. Then the king had a desire that somebody
should come to tell him stories. People said that
there were two brothers there who could tell stories. They
came to tell stories.</p>

<p>They began to tell a story. &lsquo;There was a king who had
a queen; the queen became the mother of two sons; on
the head of each was a moon, on the nape of the neck a
star. Afterwards the king went hunting; the queen wrote
a letter and sent it. The man went to her sister&rsquo;s for the
night; she took the letter, opened it, and wrote that it was
not a snake nor a lizard&mdash;it was nobody knew what, that
the queen had been the mother of. The king read it
through, and replied that it was to be reared, whether it
were a snake or a lizard. The man went homewards, and
again rested at the house where he had passed the night.
She opened the letter, and wrote that she was to bury it
&lsquo;<em>by my arrival</em>.&rsquo; Then she dug two holes&mdash;graves&mdash;and
buried them; and two maples grew out, a golden stem and
a silver one. The new queen contrived that they should be
cut down and a bed made of them, and began to sleep on it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
and began to be uncomfortable: she ordered the bed to be
cut up and burnt, and the ashes to be thrown out into the
yard. A shepherd was driving sheep; a ewe swallowed
some of the ashes and bore two he-lambs; each had a moon
on the head and a star on the back of the neck. The queen
ordered the lambs to be slaughtered, and their entrails to be
thrown out into the street. Her divorced sister went out into
the street, collected the entrails, took them to her house,
cooked and ate them, and became the mother of two sons;
each had a moon on his head and a star on the nape of
his neck.&rsquo; The boys bowed and took off their caps, thus
illuminating the whole room. The second wife was placed
on an iron harrow, and torn to pieces, but the king took his
first wife, and they began to live happily.</p>

<h3><a name="part02b" id="part02b"></a><i>LITTLE RUSSIAN STORIES.</i></h3>

<p class="center">(FROM GALICIA.)</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>R. RALSTON does not seem to have been directly
acquainted with these tales; at any rate, none of
them are given in either his book of Russian folk-tales or in
that of Russian songs. It is, therefore, the more necessary
for me to supplement his admirable work by giving all the
Galician stories in Erben&rsquo;s collection.</p>

<p>The Little Russians, or Ruthenians, form the bulk of the
population in the Austrian province of Galicia, formerly the
principality of Halicz, and also designated &lsquo;Red Russia.&rsquo;
The capital is Lemberg (contracted from L&ouml;wenberg), or
Lv&oacute;v. They are also found in the adjoining parts of the
north of Hungary, and in the Bukovina.</p>

<p>I think that the present selection is the first introduction
of the literature of the Austrian Russians to the notice of
the British reader.</p>

<p>The prophet Elijah (<i>Ilya</i>) is a very important and powerful
personage in Russian folklore, and we find him accordingly
in <a href="#chap27">No. 27</a> holding a prominent position in the heavenly
hierarchy, even before the creation of man! He seems to
have taken the place of Perun, the god of thunder, among
the heathen Slavonians.</p>

<p>I must also draw attention to the extreme stupidity of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
&lsquo;devils&rsquo; of Slavonic folklore. They are still less intelligent
than their Teutonic brethren, and do not appear to have
any connection with the Arch Enemy, but to be, as Mr.
Ralston says (p. 370), rather &lsquo;the lubber fiends of heathen
mythology, beings endowed with supernatural might, but
scantily provided with mental power.&rsquo; <a href="#chap26">No. 26</a> gives a
specimen of their average intelligence.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap24" id="chap24"></a>XXIV.&mdash;GOD KNOWS HOW TO PUNISH MAN.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a wealthy, a very wealthy proprietor; he had
buildings enough; there was where and wherewith for every
purpose. Once upon a time he had guests at his house, and
said to them: &lsquo;If my buildings were to be burnt down, I
should know where and how to rebuild them.&rsquo; He said,
and it came to pass. While he was conversing thus with his
guests, somebody went out into the courtyard, but returned
still quicker and said: &lsquo;You&rsquo;re on fire!&rsquo; But the proprietor
said: &lsquo;Never mind; I wish it to be so.&rsquo; He neither
attempted to extinguish the fire himself nor allowed others
to do so, and thus all was reduced to ashes; only the site
was left. But he didn&rsquo;t trouble himself a bit, but went and
lived by the waterside, and kept his money in a willow-tree,
being thus a source of danger to himself. Unexpectedly a
heavy rain fell, and before he could look about him the
water had already undermined the willow and carried it
away. He then became poor, so that it became his lot to
serve others. He was obliged to carry letters for gentlemen.</p>

<p>Well, it came to pass once that he was going with a letter,
and night overtook him on the way; what was he now to
do? He begged a night&rsquo;s lodging at a certain man&rsquo;s house;
this man was rich and kindly, so he said: &lsquo;Good! you shall
not pass my house.&rsquo; Meanwhile the mistress prepared
supper, and after supping they prayed to God, but before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
they lay down to sleep they conversed together about this
and that. The traveller began to relate how he had himself
been wealthy, how he had been burnt out, and had come to
poverty. &lsquo;I had,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;still a little money, and kept it
in a willow-tree, but great floods came, undermined the
willow, and carried my money away with the water! Thus
I remained with nothing, and now it has been my lot more
than once to beg for bread.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Scarcely had his host heard this when he looked at his
wife, for the willow had floated to shore under their barn,
and when they began to cut it up, the money tumbled out a
little at a time. They both went out into a room, and
began to consult how to return the money to him without
his knowing whence it came. They consulted. Then said
the host: &lsquo;Well, what shall we do? Let us cut off the
under part of a loaf, take out the crumb, put the money
inside, then cover it again with the crust; and when he is
on the point of departing let us give it him, as if it were
provision for his journey.&rsquo; And so they did. The next day
when he was starting to proceed on his way, they gave him
the loaf of bread, and said: &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s for you; it will be of
use on the road.&rsquo; He took it, made his bow, and went on
his way. On the road there met him some merchants&mdash;pardon
me, some drovers&mdash;purchasing swine, who had
formerly visited him more than once, and they asked him:
&lsquo;Of course you know what we&rsquo;re after?&rsquo; and he replied:
&lsquo;Formerly it was at my house; misfortune has come upon
me; I&rsquo;ve been burnt out, and now I serve others.&rsquo;
When he had spoken these words he all at once gave his
knapsack a tap, and said: &lsquo;Come! buy some bread.&rsquo; (He
took it out.) &lsquo;Somehow I&rsquo;m not hungry, and it&rsquo;s heavy to
carry; some money would be more advantageous on my
journey.&rsquo; Bargain and sale. They came to an agreement.
The merchants took the bread and he the money, and they
parted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
The merchants came to that very same village, and went
to the house of that very same proprietor, from whom the
bread came, and began to make inquiries of him respecting
their business. &lsquo;Not I, but God!&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;sit down,
meanwhile, and rest;&rsquo; and he sent for a snack for them. But
they said to him that he needn&rsquo;t trouble himself. &lsquo;On the
road we bought a loaf of excellent bread from a man who
was going with a letter.&rsquo; They (the host and his wife) felt a
quaking at the heart; they had a suspicion; but the
merchants soon took it out and placed it on the table, the
very same loaf, which they had given to the traveller. The
proprietor looked at his wife, and said to their guests:
&lsquo;Before anything is done, let us go and have a look round;
maybe you will make a purchase.&rsquo; &lsquo;Let us go!&rsquo; and they
went out of the house, but he winked to his wife, and she
knew at once what he wanted. When they went out on
their business, the mistress brought out another loaf and
placed it on the table, but removed the first one. They returned,
breakfasted, either did or didn&rsquo;t come to terms, and
went away.</p>

<p>After some time the man came again with a letter, and
turned in again at the proprietor&rsquo;s, just as at an old acquaintance&rsquo;s,
for the night. They received him and were
glad, for they thought they might now be successful in
returning the money somehow or other. They waited;
they passed the night, and when he had gone out of the
house, they wrapped the money in a cloth, put it in his
knapsack, gave him breakfast, and dismissed him. He
went off, and as he went by a footpath through the orchard,
he bethought himself: &lsquo;Ah! what beautiful apples! Come!
let me pluck a few for my journey.&rsquo; He took off his knapsack
and hung it on a tree, that it mightn&rsquo;t embarrass him,
and began himself to reach after the apples. Just then up
came his host, the proprietor. He saw him, and took flight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
so much the quicker, leaving his knapsack on the tree.
The proprietor espied the knapsack hanging on a branch,
began to think, and afterwards also said: &lsquo;The poor fellow
was frightened, and has forgotten his knapsack.&rsquo; He took
down the knapsack, and said: &lsquo;His road goes to the foot-bridge;
he ran away through the bushes that he mightn&rsquo;t
see me. I&rsquo;ll put it on the bridge, and then he&rsquo;ll be sure to
take it up.&rsquo; Even so he did. He ran round sideways,
placed the money on the bridge, and went himself behind a
bush not very far off, to keep a look-out and see what would
happen.</p>

<p>Suddenly the traveller came up to the bridge, and looking
downwards thought, and afterwards said: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s good that I
still have some sight, at any rate, and can go on my way and
earn something to get my bread. What should I do if I
were to go blind? How should I get across this bridge?
Come, I&rsquo;ll see whether I could do it successfully.&rsquo; Then,
closing his eyes, tap, tap, with his stick over the bridge, he
went straight forwards, stepped over the money, and went
his way. The proprietor, recovering from his astonishment,
said aloud: &lsquo;He has angered God!&rsquo;</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap25" id="chap25"></a>XXV.&mdash;THE GOOD CHILDREN.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Lord was angered at mankind, and for three years
there was a great famine over all the world; nowhere in the
world was even a grain of corn produced, and what people
sowed failed to come up from a drought so great, that for
three years there was not a drop of rain or dew. For one
year more people managed to live somehow or other, thrashing
up what old corn there was; the rich made money, for
corn rose very high. Autumn came. Where anybody had
or purchased old seed, they sowed it; and entreated the
Lord, hoped in the love of God, if God would give fertility,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
&lsquo;if God would forgive our sins.&rsquo; But it was not so. They
did not obtain the love of God. When they cast the seed
into the holy earth, that was the last they saw of it; if it
germinated somewhat, if it sent up shoots, it withered away
close to the ground. Woe! and abundance of it! God&rsquo;s
world went on, sorrowed and wept, for now it was manifest
that death by hunger was approaching. They somehow got
miserably through the winter. Spring came. Where anybody
had still any grain, they sowed it. What would come
to pass? No blessing was poured forth, for the drought
began with wind. Moreover, there was but little snow in
the winter, and everything dried up so that the black earth
remained as it was. It now came to this&mdash;all the world
began to perish! The people died; the cattle perished; as
misery carried them, so did the people proceed.</p>

<p>There was at that time a powerful emperor in a certain
empire; as the young ordinarily cleave to the young, so
would he associate only with young men. Whether in
council or in office or in the army, there were none but
young men; no old man had access to anything anywhere.
Well, as young men, unripe in understanding, were
the counsellors, so was their counsel also unripe. One year
passed, a second passed; then, in the third year, they saw
that misery was already on every side, that it was already
coming to this, that all the world would perish. The young
emperor assembled his young council, and they began to
advise after their fashion; they advised, they advised, and
ah! the resolutions they came to were such that it is a sin
even to give an account of their resolutions! Well, the
emperor made proclamation after their advice, that all old
people were to be drowned, in order that, said he, bread
might not be wasted in vain, but there might be a supply of
bread for the young; and that no one should venture, on
pain of death, to maintain or harbour any old man. Well,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
heralds went about throughout the whole country, and promulgated
the emperor&rsquo;s command everywhere&mdash;yea, brigands
seized old people where they chose, and drowned them
without mercy.</p>

<p>There were then in a certain place three own brothers,
who had an aged father. When they heard of this edict,
they told their father; and their father said: &lsquo;My sons, such
is the will of God and the will of the emperor; take me, let
me perish at once, only that you, my children, may live on.
I am already with one foot in the grave.&rsquo; &lsquo;No, our own
daddy! we will die, but we will not give you up,&rsquo; cried the
good sons with one voice, and fell upon his neck; &lsquo;we will
keep you; we will take from our own mouths, and will
nourish you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The three brothers took their aged father, conducted him
into their cottage, dug under the raised portion of the floor,
made up a bed with sheets and frieze-coats, for straw was
scarce, and placed the old man there, brought him a loaf of
bread as black as the holy earth, and covered him over with
the floor. There the old man abode for two or three months,
and his sons brought him clandestinely all that they had.
The summer passed without harvest, without mowing. September
passed too. Autumn passed without joy. Winter
passed too. Now came spring; the sun became warm. It
was now time to sow, but there was no seed. The world
was large, but there was no seed-corn. When one kind was
used up, the people sowed others, hoping that there would
be a crop; but when they cast it into the holy earth, it
rotted there. It seemed as if the end of the world were
come.</p>

<p>Then the three sons went to their father, and asked him:
&lsquo;Daddy, what shall we do? It&rsquo;s time to sow. God is now
sending showers of rain; the earth is warmed and is
crumbling like grits; but of seed there is not a blessed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
grain.&rsquo; &lsquo;Take, my sons, and strip the old roof off the house,
and thresh the bundles and sow the chaff.&rsquo; The lads stripped
the house and barn (anyhow, there was nothing in it), and
threshed away till the sweat ran from their brows, so that
they crushed the bundles as small as poppy-seeds. When
they sowed, God gave a blessing; so in a week&rsquo;s time it
became green like rue; in a month&rsquo;s time, in two months&rsquo;
time, there was corn, ever so much&mdash;ever so much, and all
manner of seed was found there: there was rye, there was
wheat and barley; yea, maybe, there was also a plant or
two of buckwheat and millet. Wherever you went throughout
the world there was no corn to be seen; all the plain
was overgrown with grasses, steppe-grasses, and thistles, but
with <em>them</em> was corn like a forest. How people wondered
and were astounded! The fame thereof went over the whole
world, and the news reached the emperor himself, that in
such and such a place there were three own brothers, and
with them corn had sprung up for all the world, and so
beautiful, never was the like beheld! The emperor ordered
the three brothers to appear in the imperial presence.</p>

<p>The brothers heard of it, and smacked the tops of their
heads with their hands. &lsquo;Now it will be amen with us!&rsquo;
They went again to their father. &lsquo;Daddy! they tell us to
appear before the emperor. Advise us, daddy, what to do!&rsquo;
&lsquo;Go, my sons&mdash;what will be, will be; and tell the pure
truth before the emperor.&rsquo; The brothers started off and
went to the emperor. The emperor inquired menacingly:
&lsquo;Why, villains, did ye hoard up corn, when there was such
a famine that so many people died of hunger? Tell the
truth; if not, I shall order you to be tortured and racked
even unto death.&rsquo; The brothers related all as it had been,
from the beginning to the end. &lsquo;Now, most gracious
emperor, give us over to any torture whatever, or let thy
kindness have compassion on us!&rsquo; The emperor&rsquo;s brow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
became smooth, his eyes became serene. He then ordered
the old father to be brought before him at once, and made
him sit beside him close to his throne, and hearkened to his
counsel till death, and his sons he rewarded handsomely.
He ordered the corn to be collected ear by ear, and to be
rubbed out in men&rsquo;s hands; and sent it about for seed-corn
in all empires, and from it was produced holy corn for all
the world.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap26" id="chap26"></a>XXVI.&mdash;THE DEVIL AND THE GIPSY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">An</span> old gipsy went to engage himself as servant to a
devil; the devil said: &lsquo;I will give you what you wish to
bring me fire-wood and water regularly, and to put fire under
the kettle.&rsquo; &lsquo;Good!&rsquo; The devil gave him a pail and said:
&lsquo;Go yonder to the well and draw some water.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Our gipsy went off, got some water into the pail, and
drew it up with a hook; but, being old, he couldn&rsquo;t draw it
out, and was obliged to pour the water out, in order not to
lose the pail in the well. But what was he now to return
home with? Well, our gipsy took some stakes out of a
fence, and grubbed round about the well, as if he were
digging. The devil waited and waited, and as the gipsy
didn&rsquo;t appear himself, of course he didn&rsquo;t appear with the
water. After awhile he went himself to meet the gipsy,
and without thinking inquired: &lsquo;But why do you loiter so?
Why haven&rsquo;t you brought water by this time?&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, what?
I want to dig out the whole well, and bring it to you!&rsquo;
&lsquo;But you would have wasted time, if you had purposed anything
of the sort; then you wouldn&rsquo;t have brought the pail
in time, that the quantity of fire-wood might not be
diminished.&rsquo; And he drew out the water and carried it
himself. &lsquo;Eh! if I had but known, I should have brought
it long ago.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
The devil sent him once to the wood for fire-wood. The
gipsy started off, but rain assailed him in the wood and
wetted him through; the old fellow caught cold and couldn&rsquo;t
stoop after the sticks. What was he to do? Well, he took
and pulled bast; he pulled several heaps, went round the
wood, and tied one tree to another with strips of the bast.
The devil waited, waited on, and was out of his wits on
account of the gipsy. He went himself, and when he saw
what was going on: &lsquo;What are you doing, loiterer?&rsquo; said he.
&lsquo;What am I doing? I want to bring you wood. I&rsquo;m tying
the whole forest into one bundle, in order not to do useless
work.&rsquo; The devil saw that he was having a bad time of it
with the gipsy, took up the fire-wood, and went home.</p>

<p>After settling his affairs at home, he went to an older
devil to ask his advice: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve hired a gipsy, but he&rsquo;s quite
a nuisance; <em>we&rsquo;re</em> tolerably &rsquo;cute,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;but he&rsquo;s still
stronger and &rsquo;cuter than we. Unless I kill him&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; &lsquo;Good,
when he lies down to sleep, kill him, that he mayn&rsquo;t lead us
by the nose any more.&rsquo; The time came to go home; they
lay down to sleep; but the gipsy evidently noticed something,
for he placed his fur-coat on the bench where he
usually slept, and crept himself into a corner under the
bench. When the time came, the devil thought that the
gipsy was now in a dead sleep, took up an iron club, and
beat the fur-coat till the sound went on all sides. He then
lay down to sleep, thinking: &lsquo;Oho! it&rsquo;s now amen for
the gipsy!&rsquo; But the gipsy grunted: &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; and made a
rustling in the corner. &lsquo;What ails you?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, a flea
bit me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The devil went again to the older one for advice: &lsquo;But
where to kill him?&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;When I smashed him with a
club, he only made a rustling and said: &ldquo;A flea bit me.&rdquo;&rsquo;
&lsquo;Then pay him up now,&rsquo; said the elder devil, &lsquo;as much as
he wants, and pack him off about his business.&rsquo; The gipsy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
chose a bag with ducats and went off. Then the devil was
sorry about the money, and consulted the older one again.
&lsquo;Overtake the gipsy, and say that the one of you that kicks
a stone best, so that the sound goes three miles, shall have
the money.&rsquo; The devil overtook him: &lsquo;Stay, gipsy! I&rsquo;ve
something to say to you.&rsquo; &lsquo;What are you after, son of the
enemy?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, stay, let us kick; the one that kicks loudest
against a stone, let his be the money.&rsquo; &lsquo;Now then, kick
away,&rsquo; said the gipsy. The devil kicked once, twice, till it
resounded in their ears; but the gipsy meanwhile poured
some water on it: &lsquo;Eh! what&rsquo;s that, you fool?&rsquo; &lsquo;When I
kick a dry stone, water spurts out.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah! when he kicks,
tremble! water has spurted out of the stone.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The devil went again for advice. The elder one said:
&lsquo;Let the one who throws the club highest have the money.&rsquo;
The gipsy had now got some miles on his way; he looked
round; the devil was behind him: &lsquo;Stop! wait, gipsy!&rsquo;
&lsquo;What do you want, son of the enemy?&rsquo; &lsquo;The one of us
that throws the club highest, let his be the money.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,
let us throw now. I&rsquo;ve two brothers up yonder in heaven,
both smiths, and it will just suit them either for a hammer
or for tongs.&rsquo; The devil threw, so that it whizzed, and was
scarcely visible. The gipsy took it by the end, scarcely held
it up, and shouted: &lsquo;Hold out your hands there, brothers&mdash;hey!&rsquo;
But the devil seized him by the hand: &lsquo;Ah, stop!
don&rsquo;t throw; it would be a pity to lose it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The elder devil advised him again: &lsquo;Overtake him once
more, and say, &ldquo;The one that runs fastest to a certain point,
let him have the money.&rdquo;&rsquo; The devil overtook him; the
gipsy said: &lsquo;Do you know what? I shan&rsquo;t contend with
you any more, for you don&rsquo;t deserve it; but I&rsquo;ve a young
son, Hare, who&rsquo;s only just three days old; if you overtake
him, you shall measure yourself with me.&rsquo; The gipsy
espied a hare in a firwood: &lsquo;There he is! little Hare!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
now, then, Hare! Catch him up!&rsquo; When the hare started
he went hither and thither in bounds, only a line of dust
rose behind him. &lsquo;Bah!&rsquo; said the devil, &lsquo;he doesn&rsquo;t run
straight.&rsquo; &lsquo;In my family no one ever did run straight. He
runs as he pleases.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The elder devil advised him to wrestle; the stronger was
to have the money. &lsquo;Eh!&rsquo; said the gipsy; &lsquo;you hear the
terms for me to wrestle with you: I have a father, he is so
old that for the last seven years I have carried him food
into a cave; if you floor him, then you shall wrestle with
me.&rsquo; But the gipsy knew of a bear, and led the devil to
his cave. &lsquo;Go,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;in there; wake him up, and
wrestle with him.&rsquo; The devil went in and said: &lsquo;Get up, longbeard!
let us have a wrestle.&rsquo; Alas! when the bear began to
hug him, when he began to claw him, he beat him out, he
turned him out, and threw him down on the floor of the
cave.</p>

<p>The elder devil advised that the one who whistled best,
so that it could be heard for three miles, should have the
money. The devil whistled so that it resounded and whizzed
again. But the gipsy said: &lsquo;Do you know what? When
I whistle you will go blind and deaf; bind up your eyes and
ears.&rsquo; He did so. The gipsy took a mallet for splitting logs,
and banged it once and twice against his ears. &lsquo;Oh, stop!
Oh! don&rsquo;t whistle, or you&rsquo;ll kill me! May ill luck smite
you with your money! Go where you will never be heard
of again!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s all.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap27" id="chap27"></a>XXVII.&mdash;GOD AND THE DEVIL.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there was nothing; there was only the
heaven above, and water beneath. Then God journeyed
[in a boat] upon the water and saw a vast, vast crust of
hard foam, on which sat the devil. God asked him: &lsquo;What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
art thou?&rsquo; &lsquo;I will not converse with thee,&rsquo; replied the wicked
one, &lsquo;unless thou takest me into thy boat.&rsquo; God promised,
and heard in reply: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m the devil.&rsquo; They both journeyed
on without conversing together at all, till the devil began:
&lsquo;How very nice and beautiful it would be, if there were
firm land in the world!&rsquo; &lsquo;There shall be,&rsquo; answered God;
&lsquo;go down into the depth of the sea and bring up a handful of
sand; I will make the land from it. When thou descendest,
and art about to take the sand, say these words: &ldquo;I take thee
in the name of God.&rdquo;&rsquo; The devil didn&rsquo;t wait long, but was
immediately under the water. On the bottom he reached
after the sand with both hands with these words: &lsquo;I take
thee in my own name.&rsquo; When he came up to the top he
looked with curiosity at his closed fists, and was astonished
at seeing that they were empty. But God, observing what
had happened to him, consoled him, and told him to go
down to the bottom once more. He did so, and as soon
as he began to grub into the sand in the deep, he said:
&lsquo;I take thee in his name.&rsquo; However, he brought up only as
much sand, as could get under his nails; God took a little
of the sand and firm land formed itself, but only as much as
was required for a bed. When night came, God and the
devil lay down side by side on the firm land to pass the
night. As soon as our Lord God fell asleep, the devil
pushed him towards the east, in order that he might fall
into the water and perish. In the direction in which he
pushed him, there did it become land for a long way. The
devil tried pushing him towards the west, and on that side
the land extended far. A similar circumstance helped to
form land also on the other sides of the world.</p>

<p>As soon as God had made the land, he ascended to
heaven. The devil, not liking to stay without him, followed
in his track. Now he heard how the angels praised God in
hymns, and began to feel annoyed, that he had no one to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
rejoice at his arrival. He went up to God and whispered
in his ear: &lsquo;What must I do, that I may have such a
multitude?&rsquo; God answered him: &lsquo;Wash thy hands and face,
and sprinkle the water behind thee.&rsquo; He did so, and there
came into existence such a multitude of devils that the
angels and saints no more had sufficient room in heaven.
God observed what an injury there was from this to his
own. He summoned St. Ilya, and ordered him to let off
a storm of thunder and lightning. Ilya was glad at this;
he roared, thundered, and lightened with a tempest, and
poured rain for forty days and nights, and along with the
great rain the devils also fell from heaven on to the earth.
At last there were no more wicked ones, and angels also
began to fall. Then God ordered Ilya to stop, and
wherever any devil struck the ground at the time that he
fell, there he remained. From that time to this bright
little fires have darted about in heaven, and only now fall
upon the earth.</p>

<h3><a name="part02c" id="part02c"></a><i>LITTLE RUSSIAN STORIES.</i></h3>

<p class="center">(FROM SOUTH RUSSIA.)</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>ERE again Mr. Ralston informs us in his preface
that he &lsquo;has been able to use but little the South
Russian collections of Kulish and Rudchenko, there being
no complete dictionary available of the dialect, or rather
language, in which they are written.&rsquo; He has, however,
given a long and interesting story from the Ukraine, which
I find also in Erben, the &lsquo;Norka.&rsquo; One of Erben&rsquo;s South
Russian stories is too closely identical with a pretty tale
from the government of Voronezh, given by Ralston (p. 63),
for me to give it a place here. All the other South Russian
stories in Erben&rsquo;s collection I have translated, and only
wish they had been more numerous.</p>

<p>The tales of Snake Husbands always appear to have an
evil end, though the two that I have translated do not conclude
so touchingly as the beautiful Great Russian story,
&lsquo;The Watersnake&rsquo; (Ralston, p. 116). Certainly the science
of comparative mythology cannot be considered as
having its data complete, until Slavonic folklore has been
thoroughly investigated and analyzed.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap28" id="chap28"></a>XXVIII.&mdash;THE BEAUTIFUL DAMSEL AND THE
WICKED OLD WOMAN.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the woods stood a cottage. In it lived a man and his
wife, but they had no children. Well, they went on a
pilgrimage to beseech God to give them a child. God gave
them a daughter. She grew and prospered. The prince
about that time rode up to the place, as he was out hunting,
and sent his attendant, saying: &lsquo;Be so good as to go and
ask for a draught of water at yon cottage.&rsquo; The attendant
went to ask for the water just when the child was weeping,
and pearls were rolling down from her eyes. Her mother
pacified her; she began to smile; all manner of flowers
bloomed. The servant went out and said: &lsquo;Prince, I have
seen a little girl; when she weeps, pearls roll down; and
when she smiles, all manner of flowers bloom.&rsquo; The prince
went into the cottage, and began to tease the child to make
her cry. She cried, and pearls rolled down. He then
begged her mother to pacify her. When she smiled, the
prince saw that all manner of flowers bloomed.</p>

<p>The girl continued to grow, and the prince always rode
round that way when he went hunting. Well, she grew up.
The prince said: &lsquo;Old man, give me your daughter to wife.&rsquo;
She now embroidered handkerchiefs with eagles. But the
emperor said: &lsquo;Where are your wits gone to, my son, that
you want to take a peasant girl to wife?&rsquo; Then the prince
took one of the handkerchiefs that she had embroidered,
and carried it to the emperor, whereat the emperor clapped
his hands. &lsquo;Marry,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;my son, marry!&rsquo; Then he
conducted her homeward, but in his suite was an old woman
who had her daughter with her. Well, as they were on
their way, the prince stopped to shoot something, and the
old woman took everything from the damsel, scooped out
her eyes, and thrust her into a cavern in the ground, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
dressed her daughter in her apparel; so the prince took her
to wife without recognising her.</p>

<p>But round the cavern there grew a multitude of bushes.
An old man came to gather brushwood. The girl, the
damsel, was sitting in the cavern, and in front of her a heap
of pearls, which she had wept as she sat; but she had no
eyes. &lsquo;Take me,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;kind old man, and pick up this
jewellery here.&rsquo; Well, the old man took her, collected the
jewellery, and led her home. At the old man&rsquo;s there were no
children, but there was an old woman. She, the damsel,
said: &lsquo;Collect the jewellery in a bag, and carry it to the town
for sale; and if a certain old woman meets you, then don&rsquo;t
sell to her, but say: &ldquo;Give what you have about you.&rdquo;&rsquo;
Well, he carried it to the town and met the old woman. The
old woman said: &lsquo;Sell me the jewellery!&rsquo; &lsquo;Purchase.&rsquo; &lsquo;How
much for it?&rsquo; &lsquo;Give what you have about you?&rsquo; She gave
him an eye. Then the damsel began with one eye to
embroider a handkerchief. Again the old man carried
jewellery to the town. The old woman again said: &lsquo;Old
man, sell me the jewellery!&rsquo; &lsquo;Purchase.&rsquo; &lsquo;How much for it?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Give what you have about you?&rsquo; She gave him the other
eye. The damsel then began to embroider still more
beautifully. The old man said: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a dinner at the
emperor&rsquo;s.&rsquo; The damsel said to him: &lsquo;Go, kind old man,
to the dinner and take a jug, that you may beg some soup
for me.&rsquo; She also tied a handkerchief of her own sewing on
the old man&rsquo;s neck. When the prince espied the handkerchief
on the old man&rsquo;s neck, he cried: &lsquo;Whence come you,
old man?&rsquo; &lsquo;From the farm yonder, prince; and there is
also a damsel living at my house, so be so kind as to give
her something in this jug.&rsquo; &lsquo;But, old man, where did you
get that handkerchief?&rsquo; &lsquo;I found a damsel in a cavern in the
ground, and she embroidered it.&rsquo; The prince at once recognised
it by the embroidery. &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis she! &rsquo;tis she!&rsquo; But the old
woman&rsquo;s daughter he packed off to tend swine. That&rsquo;s all.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap29" id="chap29"></a>XXIX.&mdash;THE SNAKE AND THE PRINCESS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was an emperor and empress who had three
daughters. The emperor fell ill, and sent his eldest
daughter for water. She went to fetch it, when a snake
said: &lsquo;Come! will you marry me?&rsquo; The princess replied:
&lsquo;No, I won&rsquo;t.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t give you any
water.&rsquo; Then the second daughter said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go; he&rsquo;ll give
me some.&rsquo; She went; the snake said to her: &lsquo;Come! will
you marry me?&rsquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rsquo; He gave her
no water. She returned and said: &lsquo;He gave me no water.
He said: &ldquo;If you will marry me I will give it.&rdquo;&rsquo; The
youngest said: &lsquo;I will go; he will give me some.&rsquo; She
went, and the snake said to her: &lsquo;Come! will you marry
me?&rsquo; &lsquo;I will,&rsquo; she said. Then he drew her water from the
very bottom, cold and fresh. She brought it home, gave it
her father to drink, and her father recovered. Then on
Sunday a carriage came, and those with it said:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&lsquo;Open the door,</div>
<div class="i2">Princess!</div>
<div class="i0">Why did the dear one love?</div>
<div class="i0">Why draw water from the ford,</div>
<div class="i2">Princess?&rsquo;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She was terrified, wept, and went and opened the door.
Then they said again:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&lsquo;Open the rooms,</div>
<div class="i2">Princess!</div>

<div class="i0">Why draw water from the ford,</div>
<div class="i2">Princess?&rsquo;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then they came into the house and placed the snake in a
plate on the table. There he lay, just as if he were of gold!
They went out of the house, and said:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>

<div class="i2">Princess!</div>
<div class="i0">Why did the dear one love?</div>
<div class="i0">Why draw water from the ford,</div>
<div class="i2">Princess?&rsquo;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They drove off with her to the snake&rsquo;s abode. There they
lived, and had a daughter born to them. They also took a
godmother to live with them, but she was a wicked woman.
The child soon died, and the mother died soon after it.
The godmother went in the night to the place where she
was buried, and cut off her hands. Then she came home,
and heated water-gruel, scalded the hands, and took off the
gold rings. Then the princess&mdash;such was the ordinance of
God&mdash;came to her for the hands, and said:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&lsquo;The fowls are asleep, the geese are asleep,</div>
<div class="i0">Only my godmother does not sleep.</div>
<div class="i0">She scalds white hands in water-gruel,</div>
<div class="i0">She takes off golden rings.&rsquo;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The godmother concealed herself under the stove. She
said again:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&lsquo;The fowls are asleep, the geese are asleep,</div>
<div class="i0">Only my godmother does not sleep.</div>
<div class="i0">She scalds white hands in water-gruel,</div>
<div class="i0">She takes off golden rings.&rsquo;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The next day they came and found the godmother dead
under the stove. They didn&rsquo;t give her proper burial, but
threw her into a hole.</p>

AND A CUCKOO.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A damsel</span> fell in love with a snake, and was also beloved by
him. He took her to wife. His dwelling was of pure glass,
all crystal. This dwelling was situated underground, in a
kind of mound, or something of the sort. Well, it is said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
that her old mother at first grieved over her. How could
she help doing so? Well, when the time came, the snake&rsquo;s
wife became the mother of twins, a boy and a girl; they
looked, as they lay by their mother, as if they were made of
wax. And she was herself as beautiful as a flower. Well,
God having given her children, she said: &lsquo;Now, then, since
they have been born as human beings, let us christen them
among human beings.&rsquo; She took her seat in a golden
carriage, laid the children on her knees, and drove off to the
village to the pope.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The carriage had not got into the
open country, when sadness was brought to the mother.
The old woman had made an outcry in the whole village,
seized a sickle, and rushed into the country. She saw she had
manifest death before her, when she called to her children,
and went on to say: &lsquo;Fly, my children, as birds about the
world: you, my little son, as a nightingale, and you, my
daughter, as a cuckoo.&rsquo; Out flew a nightingale from the
carriage by the right-hand, and a cuckoo by the left-hand
window. What became of the carriage and horses and all
nobody knows. Nor did their mistress remain, only a dead
nettle sprang up by the roadside.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap31" id="chap31"></a>XXXI.&mdash;TRANSMIGRATION OF THE SOUL.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A certain</span> woman had a kind of adventure. When she
went out into the field to cut grass, or to fetch hemp, and
placed food in the stove, then somebody took the victuals
out of the stove, and ate them all clean up. She thought,
what might such a thing as this signify? Nohow could she
guess it. She came, the door was shut, and there was only
remaining in the house a baby&mdash;maybe half a year old&mdash;in
the cradle. Well, she betook herself to a wise woman. She
entreated her and paid her to come, and she came. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
looked about, she snuffed about&mdash;I mean the wise woman.
All at once she heard something indefinite. &lsquo;Go you,&rsquo; she
said, &lsquo;into the field, and I&rsquo;ll hide myself and we&rsquo;ll see what
this is.&rsquo; The woman went into the field, and the wise
woman hid herself in a corner, and kept a look-out. Then,
pop! the baby jumped out of the cradle! She looked,
and it was no more a baby, but an old man. He was quite
dwarfish, and his beard was long. In a moment he was after
the eatables, pulled the victuals out of the stove, then gave a
screech, and began to gobble up the food. When he had
devoured all, then he became a baby again; but now he
didn&rsquo;t crawl into the cradle, but lay down, and screeched
till the whole house rang. Then the wise woman was after
him: she placed him on a block of wood, and began to
chop the block under his feet. He screeched and she
chopped: he screeched and she chopped. Then she saw
how, taking an opportunity, he became an old man again,
and said: &lsquo;Old woman, I have transformed myself not once
nor twice only: I was first a fish, then I became a bird, an
ant, and a quadruped, and now I have once more made trial
of being a human being. It isn&rsquo;t better thus than being
among the ants; but among human beings&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t worse!&rsquo;</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap32" id="chap32"></a>XXXII.&mdash;THE WIZARD.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was here once in our village a certain Avstriyat, who
was such a wizard that he could cause rain or hail to pass
away when he chose. It happened that we were cutting
corn in the country; a cloud came up. We began to hurry
off the sheaves, but he took no notice, cut and cut away by
himself, smoked his pipe, and said: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened&mdash;there&rsquo;ll
be no rain.&rsquo; Lo and behold, there was no rain.
Once&mdash;all this I saw with my own eyes&mdash;we were cutting
rye, when the sky became black, the wind rose: it began to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
whistle at first afar off, then over our very heads. There
was thunder, lightning, whirlwind&mdash;such a tempest, that&mdash;O
God! Thy will be done! We went after our sheaves, but
he&mdash;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, there&rsquo;ll be no rain.&rsquo; &lsquo;Where
won&rsquo;t it be?&rsquo; We didn&rsquo;t hearken to him. But he smoked
his pipe out, and cut away quietly by himself. Up came a
man on a black horse, and all black himself: he darted
straight up to Avstriyat: &lsquo;Hey! give permission!&rsquo; said he.
Avstriyat replied: &lsquo;No, I won&rsquo;t!&rsquo; &lsquo;Give permission; be
merciful!&rsquo; &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t. It would be impossible to get such
a quantity in.&rsquo; The black horseman bowed to the man, and
hastened off over the country.</p>

<p>Then the black cloud became gray and whitened. Our
elders feared that there would be hail. But Avstriyat took
no notice. He cut the corn by himself and smoked his
pipe. But again a horseman came up; he hastened over
the country still quicker than the first. But this one was all
in white, and on a white horse. &lsquo;Give permission!&rsquo; he
shouted to Avstriyat. &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t!&rsquo; &lsquo;Give permission, for
God&rsquo;s sake!&rsquo; &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t. It wouldn&rsquo;t be possible to get such
a quantity in.&rsquo; &lsquo;Hey! give permission; I can&rsquo;t hold out!&rsquo;
Then, and not till then, did Avstriyat relent. &lsquo;Well, then,
go now, but only into the glen, which is beyond the plain.&rsquo;
Scarcely had he spoken, when the horseman disappeared,
and hail poured down as out of a basket. In the course of
a short hour it filled the glen brimful, level with the banks.</p>

answered that an &lsquo;emperor&rsquo; (<i>tzar</i>) is chosen by God. The
King of Poland was formerly the mighty potentate west of
Moscow, which emerged from Tartar bondage under a
grand-duke, or grand-prince. This confusion may possibly
imply that the story was crystallized in its present form not
long after the assumption of the imperial dignity by the
ruler of Muscovy.</p>

<p>As to <a href="#chap34">No. 34</a>, Mr. Ralston, in his &lsquo;Songs of the Russian
People,&rsquo; gives an account of the manner in which Ilya of
Murom obtained a vast accession of strength from the still
mightier hero Svyatozor (pp. 58-63). By his exploits, however,
in the story which I have given, Ilya appears to have
already possessed strength enough for most purposes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> evening Vanyusha (Johnny) was sitting with his grandfather,
and asked his grandfather: &lsquo;Whence comes it that
bears&rsquo; paws are like our hands and feet?&rsquo; His grandfather
replied: &lsquo;Listen, Johnny. I will tell you what I have
myself heard from ancient people. Ancient people said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
bears were like human beings, like us orthodox Christians.
In a certain village there lived a poor cottager. His cottage
was wretched; he had no pony; a cow he never even
thought of; he had no fire-wood. Winter came, and it was
cold in his unwarmed room. The cottager took his axe,
and went with it into the wood. An enchanted tree&mdash;a
lime-tree&mdash;presented itself to his sight. He struck it with
his axe, and now to cut it down; but the lime-tree addressed
him in human speech: &ldquo;I will give you all that you want.
If you have no riches, if you have no wife, I will give you
all.&rdquo; The peasant said: &ldquo;Very good, mother, if you make
me richer than any of the peasants. But I have no pony,
no cow, and my cottage is wretched.&rdquo; The lime-tree said:
&ldquo;Go home; all shall be yours.&rdquo; The peasant went. A new
house was his: fences of stout boards, horses that were
ready to fly, and store-rooms full of corn. The cottager was
not satisfied, because his wife was not handsomer. What
was to be done? &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go off quick to Mother Lime-tree.&rdquo;
He took his axe, and went off into the wood.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He went into the wood to the lime-tree, and struck it
with his axe. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mother Lime-tree,
among mankind there are wives and wives, but mine is such
a disagreeable one. Do me a service: give me a handsome
wife.&rdquo; The lime-tree said: &ldquo;Go home.&rdquo; The peasant went.
His wife came to meet him&mdash;such a beauty&mdash;blood and
milk, and store-rooms full of everything good. Well, the
cottager began to live comfortably with his young wife, and
thought: &ldquo;It is a fine thing for us to live possessed of
riches, but we&rsquo;re under a superior authority. Is it impossible
for me to be the superior authority myself?&rdquo; He
thought it over with his wife. He went again to the enchanted
lime-tree.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He went into the wood, he struck it with his axe. &ldquo;What
do you want, peasant?&rdquo; &ldquo;What, indeed, Mother Lime-tree!
It&rsquo;s a fine thing for us to live in possession of riches; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
we&rsquo;re under a superior authority. Is it impossible for me to
be head-borough myself?&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well: go home; all shall
be yours.&rdquo; No sooner had the cottager got home, when a
letter came for him&mdash;&ldquo;The cottager was to be head-borough.&rdquo;
The cottager got used to living as head-borough, and
thought to himself: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine thing to be head-borough;
but all is under the control of the lord of the manor. Is it
impossible for me to be the lord myself?&rdquo; He considered
the matter with his wife, they consulted together, and he
went off again to the lime-tree.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He went up to it, and struck it with his axe. The tree
asked him: &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; &ldquo;Thanks to you, mother,
for all; but how not to doff my cap before the lord, to
become the lord myself?&rdquo; &ldquo;What is to be done with you?
Go home; it shall all be yours.&rdquo; Scarcely had he got home,
when up drove the lord-lieutenant, and brought him a letter
from the king, that &ldquo;he was to be a gentleman.&rdquo; It was
advantageous to be a gentleman. He began to give entertainments
and banquets. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine thing to be a gentleman,
but without an official position! Was it impossible for
him to become an official?&rdquo; They thought and talked
it over. He went off to the lime-tree and struck it
with his axe. &ldquo;What do you want, peasant?&rdquo; &ldquo;I thank
you, mother, for all; but is it impossible for me to be an
official?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, then, go home!&rdquo; No sooner had he got
home, when a royal letter arrived&mdash;he was invested with
orders. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine thing to be decorated, but all is under
the control of the lord-lieutenant. Is it impossible for me to be
lord-lieutenant myself?&rdquo; He thought it over with his wife,
went off into the wood to the enchanted tree, the lime-tree.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He came to the lime-tree and struck it with his axe. It
said: &ldquo;What do you want, peasant? With what are you
discontented?&rdquo; &ldquo;I thank you, mother, for everything; but
is it impossible for me to be lord-lieutenant myself, and to
have a rich patrimony?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is difficult to effect this. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
what is to be done with you? Go home!&rdquo; The cottager
had scarcely got home, when a letter arrived&mdash;the cottager
was to be lord-lieutenant, and was presented with an estate
of inheritance. The cottager became used to living as lord-lieutenant&mdash;indeed,
by descent, he was not a peasant. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a fine thing for me to live as lord-lieutenant, but all is under
the control of the king.&rdquo; He considered; he went off into
the wood to the enchanted tree, the lime-tree.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He came to it, and struck it with his axe. The tree
inquired: &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; &ldquo;All is excellent; I
thank you for all; but is it impossible for me to be king
myself?&rdquo; The lime-tree began to try to persuade him.
&ldquo;Foolish man, for what are you asking? Consider what
you were, and what you have become. From a cottager you
have become a man of high rank and everything; but an
emperor<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> is chosen by God.&rdquo; The lime-tree endeavoured
to persuade him with all manner of arguments that he had
better not make the request, but all in vain. The cottager
would not budge, but insisted that it should make him
emperor. The lime-tree said to him: &ldquo;It is impossible to
effect this, and it will not be done; you will lose, too, what
you have already obtained!&rdquo; But the cottager still insisted.
The lime-tree said: &ldquo;Become a bear, and your wife a she-bear!&rdquo;
And he became a bear, and she a she-bear. They
went off bears.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The grandson inquired: &lsquo;Grandfather, can this be a true
story?&rsquo; &lsquo;In reality &rsquo;tis a fable. Do not desire what is impossible;
be content with a little. If you desire much, you
will lose what you have obtained.&rsquo;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap34" id="chap34"></a>XXXIV.&mdash;ILYA OF MUROM AND NIGHTINGALE THE
ROBBER.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the famous city of Murom, in the village of Karatcharof,
lived a peasant, Ivan Timofeewitch. He had an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
only child, Ilya Murometz. He sat as children do for
thirty years, and when thirty years had passed, he began to
walk firmly on his feet, became conscious of vast strength,
made himself a warrior&rsquo;s equipment and a steel spear, and
saddled a good horse, worthy of a hero. He went to his
father and mother, and begged their blessing. &lsquo;My
honoured father and mother, let me go to the famous city
of Kief to perform my devotions to God, and to kneel to the
Prince of Kief.&rsquo; His father and mother gave him their
blessing, laid upon him serious injunctions, and spoke to
this effect: &lsquo;Ride straight to the city of Kief, straight to the
city of Chernigof, and on your road do no injury, shed no
Christian blood causelessly.&rsquo; Ivan Murometz received the
blessing of his father and mother, prayed to God, took
leave of his father and mother, and started on his journey.</p>

<p>He travelled far on into the gloomy forest, until he came
to a robbers&rsquo; camp. The robbers espied Ilya Murometz,
and their robber hearts burned for his heroic horse, and
they began to talk together about taking his horse from him,
for they were not wont to see such horses anywhere, and
now an unknown man was riding on so good a horse.
And they arose to assail Ilya Murometz by tens and twenties.
Ilya Murometz halted his heroic horse, and took out of his
quiver an arrow of guelder-rosewood, and placed it on his
tough bow. He shot the arrow of guelder-rosewood along
the ground, and it penetrated to the distance of a fathom
slanting. Seeing this, the robbers were terrified, collected
into an orb, fell on their knees, and said: &lsquo;You are our lord
and father, valiant and good youth! We are guilty before
you; take for such a fault as ours as much as you please of
coloured raiment and herds of horses.&rsquo; Ilya smiled and
said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve nowhere to put it; but if you wish to live, don&rsquo;t
venture any further!&rsquo; and rode on his way to the famous city
of Kief.</p>

<p>He rode on to the city of Chernigof, and under that city
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
of Chernigof were standing armies of heathen innumerable,
and they were besieging the city of Chernigof, and wanted
to destroy it and ravage the churches of God therein, and
to take into captivity the Prince and Duke of Chernigof
himself. Ilya Murometz was terrified at this great force;
nevertheless, he committed himself to the Lord God, his
Creator, and determined to risk his head for the Christian
faith. Ilya Murometz began to slaughter the heathen forces
with his steel spear, and defeated all the pagan power, and
took captive the heathen prince, and led him into the city
of Chernigof. The citizens came out of the city of
Chernigof to meet him with honour; the Prince and Duke
of Chernigof came himself. They received the good youth
with honour, and gave thanks to the Lord God, because the
Lord unexpectedly sent deliverance to the city, and caused
them not all to perish in vain at the hands of such a heathen
host. They received him into their houses, made him a
great entertainment, and let him proceed on his journey.</p>

<p>Ilya Murometz rode off towards the city of Kief by the
direct road from Chernigof, which had been beset for full
thirty years by Nightingale the robber, who allowed neither
horseman nor foot-traveller to pass, and slew them not by
any weapon, but by his robber whistling. Out rode Ilya
Murometz into the open country, and espied the tracks of
horses, and rode on upon them, and arrived at the Branskian
forest, at the muddy swamps, at the bridges of guelder-rosewood,
and at the river Smorodinka. Nightingale the
robber forboded his end and a great misfortune, and before
Ilya Murometz approached within twenty versts, began to
whistle vigorously with his robber whistling; but the hero&rsquo;s
heart was not terrified. Then, before he approached within
ten versts, he began to whistle still more violently, and from
this whistling Ilya Murometz&rsquo;s horse tottered under him.
Ilya Murometz rode up to the nest itself, which was constructed
upon twelve oaks. Nightingale the robber espied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
the hero of Holy Russia, whistled with all his might, and
wanted to smite Ilya Murometz to death.</p>

<p>Ilya Murometz took down his tough bow, placed on it an
arrow of guelder-rosewood, shot it at Nightingale&rsquo;s nest,
struck his right eye and knocked it out. Nightingale the
robber tumbled down like a sack of oats. Ilya Murometz
took Nightingale the robber, bound him fast to his steel
stirrup, and rode on towards the famous city of Kief. On
the way stood a mansion belonging to Nightingale the
robber, and when Ilya Murometz came opposite the
robber&rsquo;s mansion, the windows thereof were open, and at
these windows the robber&rsquo;s three daughters were looking
out. The youngest daughter saw him, and cried to her
sisters: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s our father outside coming with booty, and
leading to us a man bound to his steel stirrup.&rsquo; But the
eldest daughter looked, and began to weep bitterly. &lsquo;That
isn&rsquo;t our father coming: it&rsquo;s an unknown man coming,
and leading our father.&rsquo; They began to scream to their
husbands: &lsquo;Our dear husbands! ride and meet the man,
and take our father from him; do not let our family be put
to such contempt.&rsquo; Their husbands, strong heroes, rode
against the hero of Holy Russia; their horses were good,
their spears were sharp, and they were about to receive Ilya
on their spears. Nightingale the robber espied this, and
said to them: &lsquo;My dear sons-in-law, do not cause yourselves
to be put to shame, and do not provoke so mighty a hero;
rather with humility entreat him to drink a cup of green
wine in my house.&rsquo; At the request of the sons-in-law, Ilya
turned into the house, not knowing their villainy. The
eldest daughter raised on chains an iron slab, which was
placed over the door, in order to crush him. But Ilya
observed her at the door, struck her with his spear, and
smote her to death.</p>

<p>When Ilya Murometz arrived at Kief city, he rode straight
to the prince&rsquo;s palace, and entered the house, which was of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
white stone, prayed to God, and knelt to the prince. The
Prince of Kief asked him: &lsquo;Tell me, good youth, how men
name you, and of what city you are a native?&rsquo; Ilya
Murometz made reply: &lsquo;My lord, men call me Little Ilya,
but by my father&rsquo;s family I am an Ivanof; a native of the
city of Murom, of the village of Karatcharof.&rsquo; The prince
inquired: &lsquo;By what road did you ride from Murom?&rsquo; &lsquo;By
that of Chernigof, and under the walls of Chernigof I
defeated an innumerable heathen host, and delivered the
city of Chernigof. Thence I proceeded by the direct road,
and took captive the mighty hero, Nightingale the robber,
and led him hither with me bound to my steel stirrup.&rsquo;
The prince, becoming angry, said: &lsquo;What a lie you are
telling!&rsquo; When the heroes, Alesha Popovitch and Dobrynya
Nikititch, heard this, they flew to look, and assured the
prince that it really was so. The prince ordered a cup of
green wine to be brought to the good youth. The prince
had a wish to listen to the robber&rsquo;s whistling. Ilya enveloped
the prince and princess in a sable mantle, placed
them beneath his arms, summoned Nightingale, and commanded
him to give the Nightingale whistle with half
strength. But Nightingale the robber whistled with his full
robber whistle, and deafened the heroes, so that they fell on
the floor. For this Ilya Murometz slew him.</p>

<p>Ilya Murometz made a brotherhood with Dobrynya Nikititch.
They saddled their good steeds, and rode into the
open country to seek adventures; and they rode full three
months without finding any adversary. But they rode on in
the open country; there came a wandering beggar: the
ragged dress upon his back weighed fifty poods, his hat
nine poods, his staff was ten fathoms long. Ilya Murometz
began to urge his horse toward him, and was about to
match his heroic strength with him. The wandering beggar
recognised Ilya Murometz, and said: &lsquo;Oh! you are Ilya
Murometz. If you remember, we learnt to read and write
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
together at one school, and now you are urging your horse
against a poor cripple like me, as against an enemy. But
this you don&rsquo;t know, that in the famous city of Kief a great
misfortune has happened. An infidel, a mighty hero, the
unclean Idolishtcha, has arrived. His head is as big as a
beer caldron, his shoulders are a fathom broad, the distance
between his eyebrows is a span, that between his ears is an
arrow of guelder-rosewood; he eats an ox at a time, and
drinks a caldron at a draught; and the Prince of Kief is
very grieved about you, because you have left him in such
perplexity.&rsquo; Clothing himself in the beggar&rsquo;s dress, Ilya
Murometz went straight to the prince&rsquo;s court, and cried with
heroic voice: &lsquo;Oh, is it you, Prince of Kief? Send me an
alms, wandering beggar that I am.&rsquo; The prince saw him,
and spake as follows: &lsquo;Come into the palace to me, beggar;
I will give you your fill of food and drink, and gold for your
journey.&rsquo; And the beggar entered the palace and stood by
the stove; he looked on at what was occurring. Idolishtcha
asked for something to eat. They brought him a whole
ox roasted, and he ate it up, bones and all. Idolishtcha
asked for something to drink. They brought him a caldron
of beer, carried by twenty men; he took it up by the
handles, and drank it all up. Ilya Murometz said: &lsquo;My
father had a greedy mare; she over-ate herself and died.&rsquo;
Idolishtcha didn&rsquo;t stand that, and said: &lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you,
wandering beggar! Why do you insult me? It&rsquo;s nothing
to me to take you up in my hands. Nay, what are you?
If such an one as Ilya Murometz was among you, I&rsquo;d make
a fight of it even with him.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then here&rsquo;s such an one as
he,&rsquo; said Ilya Murometz, and, taking off his hat, struck him
gently on the head with it.&mdash;But he broke through the wall
of the house, took the corpse of Idolishtcha, and threw it
out by the rent. For this the prince honoured Ilya
Murometz with great commendations, and placed him on
the list of mighty heroes.</p>

<h3><a name="part03a" id="part03a"></a><i>BULGARIAN STORIES.</i></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Bulgarians do not derive their name from a Slavonic
origin, but from a small and warlike nation of horsemen,
which in <small>A.D.</small> 679 crossed the Danube under a chief
named Isperich, conquered the disunited Slavonic tribes that
had settled in M&oelig;sia, and consolidated them into a powerful
realm. The conquerors melted into the conquered, and
lost their language, but gave their name to the state and
country. The Slavonic language of the people does not
appear to have been affected by that of their Ugrian conquerors,
but rather by the old Thracian language, which,
conjointly with Latin, has produced the present Roumanian.
The peculiarities of the present Bulgarian language are:
(1) the loss of case-inflexions in nouns and adjectives, while
the verbal system is most complete and complex; (2) the
expression of the genitive and dative cases by prefixing the
preposition <i>na</i>; (3) the post-positive article, which is also
borrowed from the old Thracian language, which was akin
to the Illyrian now spoken by the present Albanians and
Epirots; (4) the loss of the infinitive mood, which is replaced
by <i>da</i> with the finite verb. Baron Wenceslas
Wratislaw, in describing his journey through Bulgaria in
1591, says of the people: &lsquo;They use a Slavonic language,
so that we Bohemians can converse with them.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
The Bulgarian tales themselves are curious, and some of
them very beautiful, as are also the songs, to which considerable
space is devoted by Mr. Morfill in his &lsquo;Slavonic Literature&rsquo;
(pp. 125-144). There are old traditions as to the world
and its inhabitants, apparently of heathen origin (<a href="#chap35">No. 35</a>);
a singular fusion of the history of Abraham and Isaac with
some other, probably heathen, tradition (<a href="#chap36">No. 36</a>); a version
of &lsquo;Cinderella&rsquo; (<a href="#chap37">No. 37</a>), which, involving as it does the
transmigration of souls, clearly exhibits an Indian origin; a
beautiful story (<a href="#chap38">No. 38</a>), the latter part of which is a variant
of the latter part of the Russian tale of &lsquo;Marya Morevna&rsquo;
(Ralston, p. 85), and <a href="#chap39">No. 39</a>, in the latter part of which
many people will recognise a variant of an old acquaintance.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap35" id="chap35"></a>XXXV.&mdash;THE LORD GOD AS AN OLD MAN.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the beginning, when man began to plough, when he had
cut a furrow from one end to the other, he lifted his plough
on to his shoulder, and when he had carried it back to the
same end that he had begun from, he began again to plough
thence. The Lord, in the form of an old man, passed by
and said to him, &lsquo;Not thus, my son, but when you make a
furrow, turn your plough round at the same place to which
you have cut the furrow, and plough back to the end from
which you began.&rsquo; And thus the ploughman learnt to
plough aright, as people plough at this day.</p>

<p>Thence the Lord went away in the form of an old man,
and saw a woman who was weaving at a loom, and putting
the thread, three threads at a time, into her mouth; she bit
the thread off at one end, and began again at the same side.
The Lord said to her, &lsquo;Not thus, daughter; but put the
thread hither and thither with two hands without biting the
thread off.&rsquo; And she learnt to weave as people weave at
this day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
The next day the Lord again passed alongside of the
ploughman in a different guise, and asked him: &lsquo;Who taught
you, my son, to plough thus?&rsquo; He replied to him: &lsquo;The
Lord God, in the form of an old man.&rsquo; The Lord blessed
him, and said: &lsquo;A day to plough and a year to eat!&rsquo; Afterwards
he passed by the woman and asked her: &lsquo;Who taught
you, daughter, to weave thus?&rsquo; She replied: &lsquo;Myself, my
very own self, quickly, quite quickly.&rsquo; Then the Lord said
to her: &lsquo;A year to weave, that you may carry it under the
arm!&rsquo;</p>

<p>They say, moreover, that at that time men had command
not only over all animals, but also over inanimate things;
but later, they say, it was altered when men became wicked.
For instance, when a man had cut logs of wood and piled
them in a heap, he struck them with a stick, and they went
of themselves whither they were required to go. But a
certain woman having cut logs and struck them to make
them go, they started; but she, being tired of walking
beside them on foot, seated herself at top, and the logs
resisted. She struck them on one side, she struck them on
the other, but they didn&rsquo;t move any whither. Then she
unfastened her girdle, and put them on her back. On the
way God showed himself to her, and said to her: &lsquo;Since
you are wicked, instead of your riding on them, let them
ride on you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the Lord walked about the earth and blessed it, he
went first to a herdsman. He was lying on his back under
a tree, a pear-tree; his pitcher, in which he fetched water
for himself, stood by empty. The Lord, in the form of an
old man, asked him: &lsquo;My son, is there any water in the
pitcher?&rsquo; He said to him: &lsquo;No.&rsquo; The Lord said to him:
&lsquo;Go, my son, to fetch me a little water, that the old man
may drink.&rsquo; The herdsman made a sign to him with his
foot: &lsquo;There is where the spring is; if you&rsquo;re thirsty, go,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
drink.&rsquo; The Lord then gave the word that all the herd should
run off as if assailed by the gadfly; then, when they began
all to run in one direction, the herdsman took his hat in
his hand and started off, and as he ran after them thought:
&lsquo;How I have sinned against God!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the Lord went to a shepherd. The shepherd also
had a pitcher. The Lord asked him: &lsquo;My son, have you any
water?&rsquo; He replied to him: &lsquo;There is water, old man, but
I cannot go to fetch it myself, or the sheep will disperse.&rsquo;
Then said the Lord: &lsquo;Go, my son; I will watch them.&rsquo;
When the shepherd went off for the water, the Lord took
the shepherd&rsquo;s staff, and when he had stuck it into the
ground, placed the shepherd&rsquo;s cloak upon it, and blessed
the sheep. They became quiet and tranquil in the shade.
During the shepherd&rsquo;s absence up came a wolf to obtain the
appointed tribute which he received every day from the
shepherd. The Lord gave him a lamb of little value. The
wolf, discontented, did not choose to take it, but darted
forward and seized another, which he liked. Then the
Lord took the shepherd&rsquo;s trumpet, and struck him on the
loins&mdash;on the spine. From this it has remained a property
of the wolf that his loins are just as weak as his neck is
strong. But he carried off the lamb which he had seized.
The Lord took two little stones, threw them after the wolf
and blessed them; they became two dogs, ran after the
wolf, and took away the lamb which the wolf had seized.
The shepherd came up bringing the Lord cold water,
and saw the sheep quiet, for they were standing in the
shade and the two dogs were frolicking round them. The
shepherd then asked the old man: &lsquo;Well, old man, now
when the sheep are standing quiet, and are like blocks of
wood, how shall I drive them to pasture?&rsquo; The Lord said
to him: &lsquo;My son, take a copper trumpet, and blow it to
them; they will start off in the direction from which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
wind blows gently.&rsquo; From that time forth down to the
present day people drive their sheep to pasture blowing
trumpets.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap36" id="chap36"></a>XXXVI.&mdash;BULGARIAN HOSPITALITY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time, when the Lord had formed the world,
he wished to see how his people lived; he came down from
heaven first of all on the Balkan Mountains, took the form
of a man with a long white beard and white clothes; took
a staff in his hand, and went about the world in the Bulgarian
land; he travelled much, a whole day long, over
desolate mountains. In the evening he came to a village
to pass the night. He went into the first house at the end
of the village and sat down on the threshold, said nothing,
but meditated by himself. The mistress was in her house
doing some work, and did not see him. But now her husband
came from the field, from his plough, espied the old man,
was delighted, and said to him: &lsquo;Old man, you are very
tired; you are a weary traveller. Come into the house;
rest yourself, if it is but a poor one. I will entertain you
with all that the Lord has given me&mdash;only say the word.&rsquo;
The old man regarded him with cheerful eyes, went into the
house and sat down. The man and his wife quickly rose
up and prepared a hospitable meal according to what they
possessed, and as nicely and as handsomely as they could,
and placed it on the table. The couple ate of their homely
meal, but the old man would not; he only smelt the homely
banquet, said nothing, but watched how the two persons
enjoyed themselves, and rejoiced. They urged him, they
begged him. &lsquo;Old man, why don&rsquo;t you eat? You will
remain hungry. Take, and taste, and try what you please.
What we have is all here before you.&rsquo; The old man only
said this: &lsquo;Eat you&mdash;eat; I am thinking of something.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
When they had eaten their fill, they rose. The mistress
went out to feed the child because it was crying. Then
said the old man to her husband: &lsquo;Do you know what,
master, if you wish to entertain me? I cannot eat everything,
but I wish for baked human flesh. Kill your little
son, wash him nicely, and place him whole on the frying-pan
in the oven; only look out that your wife does not see you,
for she will weep.&rsquo; He replied: &lsquo;Is this all that you want,
old man? Why did you not tell me long before, that you
might not have sat a hungry guest in the house? Did I
not tell you that all was yours that the Lord had given me?
Indeed, I love you exceedingly, old man; my heart tells me
that you are good and worthy, and now you shall see; only
have a little patience, till I get ready that which you desire.&rsquo;
The man went out of doors, and his wife had begun to do
some work, and had left her child to play by itself in the
moonlight till it fell asleep, without knowing what was about
to take place. Her husband stole the child, killed it with
all haste, put it entire in the frying-pan, and shut it up in
the oven, that its mother might not see it till it was cooked;
he then went to the old man, sat down by him and conversed
cheerfully with him. They had not talked long,
when the old man became silent, sniffed with his nose, and
said to the servant lad: &lsquo;Go, look at the baked meat; it
smells nicely; perhaps it is cooked.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The lad rose, went out, opened the oven to look at and
take out the baked meat. But what did he see? He was
amazed and frightened at the wonder; all the oven and all
the house was glittering with the brightness of the child.
The frying-pan and the child had become gold, and shone
like the sun. The child was sitting in the frying-pan like a
big boy&mdash;handsome, cheerful, bright, and well. On his
head was a crown of pearls and precious stones; on the
girdle at his waist was a sword. In his right hand he held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
a book of blessing; in his left hand he had a wheatsheaf full
of ears; and all this was shining more than fire, because it
had all become gold. He returned to tell the old man what
a wonder had taken place, and to ask what was to be done;
but the old man was no longer there; he had gone out in
front of the house, and said to them: &lsquo;Fare ye well, and
live as ye have done till now, honourably and contentedly.
Your good hearts will have good from field and cattle, and
blessing and peace upon your children and children&rsquo;s
children from the Lord. He will receive you and entertain
you in his heavenly house.&rsquo; He then went away alone
under cover of the night, no one knows whither.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap37" id="chap37"></a>XXXVII.&mdash;CINDERELLA.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time, a number of girls were assembled spinning
round a deep rift or chasm in the ground. As they spun
they chattered together and told stories to each other. Up
came a white-bearded old man, who said to them: &lsquo;Girls!
as you spin and chatter, be circumspect round this rift; or,
if any of you drops her spindle into it, her mother will be
turned into a cow.&rsquo; Thus saying he departed. The girls
were astonished at his words, and crowded round the rift to
look into it. Unfortunately, one of them, the most beautiful
of all, dropped her spindle into it. Towards evening, when
she went home, she espied a cow&mdash;her mother&mdash;in front of
the gate, and drove her out with the other cattle to pasture.
After some time the father of the girl married a widow, who
brought a daughter with her into the house. The second
wife had a spite at the man&rsquo;s first daughter, especially
because she was more beautiful and more industrious than
her own, and she allowed her neither to wash herself, nor to
comb her hair, nor to change her clothes. One day she
sent her out with the cattle, gave her a bag full of tow, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
told her: &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t spin this tow into yarn to-day, or if
you don&rsquo;t wind it into a ball, you had better not come
home at eventide&mdash;I shall kill you.&rsquo; It was sad for the
poor girl, as she went after the cattle, endeavouring as well
as she could to keep them together. In the afternoon, when
the cattle lay down to chew the cud, she began to look at
the bag to see how to perform her task upon it; but when
she saw that she could not make out what to do with it, she
began to cry. When the cow which was her mother saw
her crying, she asked her why she was crying. She told her
how it was, and what it was. Then said the cow to her:
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid; I will help you. I will take all the tow
into my mouth, and will chew it, and yarn will come up
into my ear. You must take it and reel it into a ball, and
you will finish it in good time.&rsquo; As she said, so it was.
She began to chew the tow, piece after piece; yarn came up
into her ear, and the girl wound and reeled it, and finished
the task. In the evening she departed and went to her
stepmother, who was amazed at seeing so much work completed.
The next time she gave her as much tow again.
The girl spun till noon, and then in the afternoon, when the
cattle lay down to chew the cud, the cow came up to her
and began to chew the tow; yarn came up into her ear, and
the girl wound and reeled it, and finished in good time. In
the evening she went home and delivered to her stepmother
all the tow spun and wound. She was astonished at seeing
so much work completed. The third time she gave her
still more tow, and sent her own daughter to see who helped
her. The daughter went and concealed herself apart, and
saw how it was and what it was, that the girl completed so
much work in the day; she saw how the cow took the tow
into her mouth, how yarn came up into her ear, and how
the girl wound and reeled it. She went home to tell her
mother. When she heard this from her daughter, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
urged her husband to kill the cow. He endeavoured in
every way to persuade her not to kill the cow, but could not
over-persuade her. At last, when he saw that there was no
escape, he promised to kill it on a certain day. When the
girl heard that they were going to kill the cow she began to
cry, and told the cow secretly that they were going to kill
her. She said to the girl: &lsquo;Be quiet&mdash;don&rsquo;t cry! If they
kill me, you must not eat any of my flesh, but must collect
the bones and bury them behind the cottage. Then if need
come to you, you must go to the grave, and help will come
to you thence.&rsquo; On hearing this she went away.</p>

<p>One day they killed the cow and boiled her flesh, brought
it into the parlour, and began to eat. The girl alone did
not eat of it, according to the instructions she had received;
but collected the bones, and then, without anybody seeing
her, took them and buried them behind the cottage, where
the cow (her mother) had ordered her so to do. The girl
was named Mary; but at length, when they had put all the
work in the cottage upon her&mdash;that is to say, to sweep, to
fetch water, to cook, to wash up the plates&mdash;she had become
dirty and begrimed with ashes and cinders from excessive
work at the fireplace; and therefore her stepmother nicknamed
her Cinderella (Pepelezka), and this remained her
name afterwards.</p>

<p>One Sunday her stepmother got ready to go to church
with her daughter, but, before starting, took a wooden dish of
millet, scattered it on the ground in the cottage, and said to
Cinderella: &lsquo;Here you, Cinderella! if you don&rsquo;t pick up
this millet, and if you don&rsquo;t get dinner ready by the time
that I return from church, don&rsquo;t come before my eyes, or I
shall put you to death.&rsquo; Then they went away. Poor Cinderella,
when she looked at all the millet, cried out weeping
and wailing: &lsquo;I will cook, I will sweep, I will attend to
everything, but what poor girl can pick up all this millet?&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
When she had wept and spoken, immediately there came into
her mind what the cow had told her, to go to the grave, and
there help would be given her in trouble. Cinderella went
off to the grave. When there, what did she see? On the
grave stood an open box, filled with all manner of rich
clothes, and on the lid were two pigeons, white as snow.
They said to her: &lsquo;Mary! take the clothes out, put them
on, and go to church, and we will pick up the millet and get
the dinner ready.&rsquo; She put out her hands and took the upper
ones, which were of pure silk and satin, put them on, and went
to church. In the church people great and small marvelled
at her beauty and her dress, especially because no one
recognised her or knew who or what she was. Most of all
did the emperor&rsquo;s son marvel at her, and never took his eyes
off her. When service was ended, she stole away and ran
quickly home, undressed immediately, and put the clothes
in the box, and the box immediately vanished from sight.
She went to the fireplace, and what did she see there? The
millet picked up, dinner ready&mdash;in one word, everything
attended to! Soon afterwards, lo! her stepmother came
with her daughter from church, saw everything in proper
order, and was astounded.</p>

<p>Next Sunday, when she was about to go to church, taking
a larger dish of millet and scattering it on the ground, she
threatened Cinderella that she would kill her if she didn&rsquo;t
pick it up and get dinner ready. The stepmother went off
with her daughter to church, and Cinderella betook herself
to the grave of the cow. On the grave she found the two
pigeons and the box with the dresses in it open. They told
her to dress herself and go to church, and they would pick
up the millet and get dinner ready. Taking a dress of
pure silver, she dressed herself and went off to church.
Now everybody, small and great, marvelled at her more than
before, and the emperor&rsquo;s son did not take his eyes off her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
for a moment. Service ended, she stole off amidst the
multitude and got away home. There she undressed, and
put the clothes in the box, and the box disappeared from
sight. Soon afterwards, lo! her stepmother came and
looked about; the millet was picked up, dinner was ready,
and Cinderella was at the fireplace. She was astonished at
seeing so much work completed.</p>

<p>The third time her stepmother got ready to go to church,
and before she started, taking a dish of millet thrice as
large, and scattering it on the ground, she said to Cinderella:
&lsquo;Cinderella, if you don&rsquo;t pick up all this millet before
we return from church, and if you don&rsquo;t get dinner ready, go
and hide yourself; don&rsquo;t come before my eyes&mdash;I shall kill
you.&rsquo; Then she went off to church. After this Cinderella
went to the grave of the cow, and found there the box open
and the two pigeons upon it. They told her to dress herself
and go to church; they would pick up the millet and get
the dinner ready. Taking a dress of pure gold, she dressed
herself and went to church. There, when the people saw
her, they marvelled, but no one knew who or what she was.
The emperor&rsquo;s son never took his eyes off her, and planned,
when service was over, to follow her closely, to see whither
she betook herself. Service ended, she stole off amidst the
crowd, hastening to get away before her stepmother; but as
she was pushing through the crowd, she lost one of her
shoes, and the emperor&rsquo;s son took it up. She escaped from
among them with one shoe, undressed very quickly, put the
clothes in the box, and the box vanished. She went home
and looked in the cottage; the millet was picked up, dinner
was ready, and everything attended to. She sat down at the
fireplace, and, lo! her stepmother came and looked about the
cottage; everything was in order, the millet picked up,
dinner ready; she had nothing to find fault with her or
scold her about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
The emperor&rsquo;s son left the people, disguised himself, took
the shoe, and went from cottage to cottage to try it on, to
find out whose it was; and wherever he went he made inquiries,
and tried it on the foot of every girl, but it did not
fit one. For some it was too large, and for others too
small; for some too narrow, for others too broad. At last
he came to Cinderella&rsquo;s cottage. As soon as her stepmother
saw him, she concealed Cinderella under a trough. He
asked whether there was any girl in the house. She replied
that there was, and brought her daughter to him. He tried
the shoe on her, but it wouldn&rsquo;t even allow her toes to go
in. He then asked whether there wasn&rsquo;t another girl there,
and she told him that there wasn&rsquo;t. The cock had flown on
to the trough, and when she told the emperor&rsquo;s son that
there was no other girl there, he crowed: &lsquo;Cock-a-doodle-doo!
pretty girl under trough!&rsquo; The stepmother shrieked
out: &lsquo;Shoo! eagles have brought you!&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> But the emperor&rsquo;s
son, on hearing the cock say this, went up and took the
trough off; and there was, indeed, the girl that he had seen
in the church with those beautiful dresses, only on one foot
she had no shoe. He tried the shoe on her; it went on,
and was exactly the same as that on the other foot. Then
the emperor&rsquo;s son took her by the hand, conducted her to
his court, married her, and punished her stepmother for her
evil heart.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap38" id="chap38"></a>XXXVIII.&mdash;THE GOLDEN APPLES AND THE NINE
PEAHENS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once upon a time an emperor who had three
sons, and in his yard a golden apple-tree, which flowered
and ripened every night; but somebody robbed it, and the
emperor was utterly unable to discover who the robber was.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
Once he was conversing with his sons, and said to them:
&lsquo;I do not know whither goes the fruit from our apple-tree.&rsquo;
Then the eldest son answered him: &lsquo;I will go to-night to
see who takes it.&rsquo; When it became dark, the eldest son did
as he had said: went out, and lay down under it. Well,
when the apples began to ripen in the course of the night,
slumber overtook him, and he fell asleep; and when he
awoke at dawn he looked&mdash;but where were the apples?
Taken away! When he saw this, he went and related all
to his father just as it really happened. The second son
said to his father: &lsquo;I will go to-night to watch, that I may
see who takes it.&rsquo; But he, too, watched it even as the first
one. About the time when the apples began to ripen, he
fell asleep. When he woke up in the morning, where were
the apples? Taken away! Now came the turn of the third
and youngest brother. He went out at eventide under the
apple-tree, placed a sofa there, lay down, and went to sleep.
About midnight, when the apples began to ripen, he woke up
and looked at the apple-tree. It had just begun to ripen,
and illuminated all the yard from the brightness of its fruit.
Just then up flew nine peahens, eight of which settled upon
the apple-tree, and the ninth on the ground beside his sofa,
and, as soon as she had alighted, became a damsel, who
shone with beauty like a bright sun. They conversed
together while the other eight were rifling the tree, and when
dawn came, she thanked him for the apples, and he begged
her to leave just one behind her. She gave him two&mdash;one
for himself, and one to take to his father&mdash;transformed herself
into a peahen, and flew away, followed by the other
eight. In the morning the prince rose up, and took one
apple to his father, who did not know what to do for joy,
and commended him without ceasing. The next evening
the youngest prince went out again to watch the apple-tree,
and as soon as he had gone out, lay down as before, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
watched it that night also. In the morning he again
brought his father an apple. This went on for a few days,
when his brothers began to envy him, because they could
not watch it, whereas he watched it successfully. They
could not make out how to discover the manner in which
he watched the apple-tree. So they sought out an old
witch, who promised them to find out how their young
brother watched the apple-tree. At the approach of evening,
when the youngest prince was about to go out to watch
the apple-tree, the accursed witch stole out and went off
before him, lay down under his sofa, and there concealed
herself. The prince came, lay down without knowing that
the old woman was under his sofa, and went to sleep as
previously. About midnight, when the prince had just woke
up, the nine peahens arrived; eight of them settled on the
tree, and the other on the ground beside his sofa, transformed
herself into a damsel, and they began to converse
together. While these were talking to each other, the
accursed old witch softly raised herself up, and cut off a
piece of the damsel&rsquo;s long hair. As soon as she felt this,
the damsel sprang on one side, transformed herself into a
peahen, and flew away, with the other eight behind her.
The prince, on seeing this, sprang off his sofa, and shouted:
&lsquo;What is this?&rsquo; He erelong espied the old woman under
the sofa, seized and hauled her from under it, and, when
morning came, ordered her to be fastened to the tails of two
horses and torn asunder. The peahens came no more to
the apple-tree, and the prince was much grieved on this
account, and wept and mourned day after day. At last he
determined to go to seek them all over the world, and went
and told his father what his intention was, and his father
endeavoured to comfort him, and said: &lsquo;Stay, my son! I
will find you another damsel in my empire, such an one as
you wish for.&rsquo; But in vain; he would not follow his father&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
advice, and made preparations to go; took with him one of
his servants, and went into the world to find the peahen.
When he had travelled a long time, he came to a lake, in
the midst of which was a rich palace, and in the palace an
aged empress, who had one daughter. The prince, on
coming to the old empress, asked her to tell him about the
nine peahens, if she knew about them; and the old woman
replied that she did, and that the nine peahens came daily
to bathe in the lake. On telling him this, she began to try
to over-persuade him with these words: &lsquo;Never mind those
nine peahens, my son. I have a handsome damsel, and
abundance of wealth&mdash;it will all remain yours.&rsquo; But as soon
as the prince heard where the peahens were, he would not
listen to her talk, but in the morning ordered his servant to
get the horses ready to go to the lake. Before they started
for the lake, the old woman called his servant, bribed him,
and gave him a little whistle, saying to him: &lsquo;When the
time approaches for the peahens to come to the lake, do
you secretly look out, and blow the whistle behind your
master&rsquo;s neck; he will immediately fall asleep, and will not
see them.&rsquo; The accursed servant hearkened to her, took
the whistle, and did as the old woman told him. When
they arrived at the shore of the lake, he calculated the time
when the peahens would arrive, blew the whistle behind his
master&rsquo;s neck, and he immediately fell as sound asleep as if
he were dead. Scarcely had he fallen asleep, when the
peahens arrived; eight of them settled on the lake, and the
ninth perched upon his horse, and began to try to awaken
him: &lsquo;Arise, my birdie! arise, my lamb! arise, my dove!&rsquo;
But he heard nothing, but slept on as if dead. When the
peahens had finished bathing, they all flew away, and he
awoke, and asked his servant: &lsquo;What is it? Did they
come?&rsquo; The servant replied: &lsquo;They did come,&rsquo; and told
him how eight of them settled on the lake, and the ninth on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
his horse, and that she tried to wake him. When the unhappy
prince heard this from his servant, he was ready to
kill himself from pain and anger. The next morning they
visited the shore of the lake again, but his accursed servant
calculated the time to blow the whistle behind his neck, and
he immediately fell asleep as if he were dead. Scarcely had
he fallen asleep, when the nine peahens arrived; eight
settled on the lake, and the ninth on his horse, and began
to try to awake him: &lsquo;Arise, my birdie! arise, my lamb!
arise, my dove!&rsquo; But he slept on as if he were dead, hearing
nothing. When the peahen failed to wake him, and
they were about to fly away again, the one which had been
trying to wake him turned and said to his servant: &lsquo;When
your master wakes, tell him that to-morrow it will once more
be possible for him to see us, but after that, never more.&rsquo;
On saying this she took flight, and the others from the lake
after her. Scarcely had they flown away, when the prince
awoke, and asked his servant: &lsquo;Did they come?&rsquo; He told
him: &lsquo;They did come, and eight of them settled on the lake,
and the ninth on your horse, and tried to wake you, but you
slept soundly. As she departed, she told me to tell you
that you will see her here once again to-morrow, and never
more.&rsquo; When the prince heard this, he was ready to kill
himself in his unhappiness, and did not know what to do
for sorrow. On the third day he got ready to go to the
lake, mounted his horse, went to the shore, and, in order
not to fall asleep, kept his horse continually in motion. But
his wicked servant, as he followed him, calculated the time,
and blew the whistle behind his neck, and he immediately
leant forward on his horse and fell asleep. As soon as he
fell asleep, the nine peahens flew up; eight settled on the
lake, and the ninth on his horse, and endeavoured to wake
him: &lsquo;Arise, my birdie! arise, my lamb! arise, my dove!&rsquo;
But he slept as if he were dead, and heard nothing. Then,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
when they were about to fly away again, the one which had
perched on his horse turned round, and said to his servant:
&lsquo;When your master wakes up, tell him to roll the under peg
on the upper, and then he will find me.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Then she flew off,
and those from the lake after her. When they had flown
away, he awoke again, and asked his servant: &lsquo;Did they
come?&rsquo; He replied: &lsquo;They did; and the one that had
perched on your horse told me to tell you to roll the upper
peg on the under one, and then you would find her.&rsquo; When
the prince heard this, he drew his sword, and cut off his
servant&rsquo;s head. When he had done this, he started to
travel on alone. When he had travelled a long time, he
came at dusk to the cottage of a hermit, and lodged there
for the night. In the evening the prince asked the hermit:
&lsquo;Grandfather, have you heard of nine golden peahens?&rsquo; The
hermit answered: &lsquo;Yes, my son; you are fortunate in having
come to me to ask about them. They are not far hence;
it is not more than half a day&rsquo;s journey to them from here.&rsquo;
In the morning, when the prince departed to seek them, the
hermit came out to accompany him, and said to him: &lsquo;Go
to the right, and you will find a large gate. When you enter
that gate, turn to the right, and then you will go right into
their town, and in that town is their palace.&rsquo; He went on
his way according to the hermit&rsquo;s words, and went on till he
came to that gate; then turned to the right, and descried
the town upon a hill. When he saw the town he was much
rejoiced. When he entered the town he inquired where the
palace of the nine peahens was. It was pointed out to him.
At the gate a watchman stopped him, and inquired whence
and who he was. The prince told him all, whence he was
and who he was. After this the watchman went off to
announce him to the empress. When she heard it, she ran
breathless, and stood in the form of a damsel before him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
took him by the hand, and led him upstairs. Then the two
rejoiced together, and in a day or two were wedded.</p>

I do not understand this expression. It is afterwards inverted by
the servant. But it has no further bearing on the story.</p>
</div>

<p>When a few days had elapsed after their marriage, the
empress departed to go on a journey, and the prince remained
alone. When she was about to start, she took out
and gave him the keys of twelve cellars, and said to him:
&lsquo;Open all the cellars, but do not have any nonsense with
the twelfth.&rsquo; She went away. When the prince remained
alone in the palace, he bethought himself: &lsquo;What does this
mean, that I am to open all the cellars, but not to open the
twelfth? Glory to the Lord God! what can there be in it?&rsquo;
He then began to open them one after the other. He came
to the twelfth, and at first would not open it; but as he
had no occupation, he began to brood and to say to himself:
&lsquo;How can it be in this cellar that she told me not to open
it?&rsquo; At last he opened it too, and found standing in the
midst of it a cask bound with iron hoops, and a voice out of
it was heard, saying: &lsquo;I pray you, brother&mdash;I am athirst for
water&mdash;give me a cup of water.&rsquo; On hearing this voice,
the prince took a cup of water, and sprinkled it on the
bung; and as soon as he had sprinkled it, one of the hoops
of the cask burst. The voice then cried: &lsquo;Give me one
more cup of water; I am athirst.&rsquo; He took a cup of water
and sprinkled it on the bung; and as soon as he had done
so, another hoop burst on the cask. The voice then cried:
&lsquo;I am athirst; give me, brother, one more cup of water.&rsquo;
The prince took another cup of water and poured it on the
bung; but as soon as he had finished pouring it, the third
hoop of the cask burst, the cask split asunder, and out of it
flew a dragon, found the empress on her way, and carried
her off. Thus it happened, and the attendants came and
told their master that a dragon had carried the empress
away. Finally he set off to seek her in the world. When
he had travelled a long time, he came to a marsh, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
that marsh espied a little fish, which was endeavouring to
jump into the water, but was unable to do so. This little
fish, on seeing the prince, addressed itself to him: &lsquo;I pray
you, brother, do a good action: throw me into the water;
I shall some time be of use to you; only take a scale from
me, and when you are in want of me, rub it between your
fingers.&rsquo; On hearing this he took a scale off it, threw the
fish into the water, put the scale into a handkerchief, and
went on his way. When he had gone a little further, he
espied a fox caught in a trap. When the fox saw him, it
called out: &lsquo;I pray you, brother, let me out of this trap; I
shall some day be of use to you; only take one or two hairs
from my fur, and when I am wanted for you, rub them
between your fingers.&rsquo; He let it out of the trap, took one
or two hairs from it, and went on his way. Thus he proceeded
onwards, till, as he went, he came to a hill, and found
a crow caught in a trap just like the fox before. As soon as
the crow saw him, it cried out: &lsquo;I pray you, be a brother to
me, traveller; let me out of this trap; I shall some day be
of use to you; only take a feather or two from me, and
when you are in want of me, rub them between your fingers.&rsquo;
The prince took one or two feathers from the crow, let it
out of the trap, and then went on his way. As he went on
to find the empress, he met a man, and asked him: &lsquo;I pray
you, brother, do you not know where is the palace of the
dragon emperor?&rsquo; The man showed him the way, and also
told him at what time he was at home, that he might find
him. The prince thanked him, and said: &lsquo;Farewell.&rsquo; He
then went on, and gradually came to the palace of the dragon
emperor. On his arrival there he found his beloved, and
when she saw him and he saw her, they were both full of
joy. Now they began to plan together how to escape.
Finally they agreed to saddle their horses and take to flight.
They saddled them, mounted, and off. When they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
ridden off, the dragon arrived and looked about, but the
empress was not to be found. &lsquo;Now what shall we do?&rsquo;
said the dragon to his horse. &lsquo;Shall we eat and drink, or
pursue them?&rsquo; The horse replied to him: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble
yourself; eat and drink.&rsquo; When he had dined, the dragon
mounted his horse and galloped after them, and in course
of time overtook them, and took the empress away, but said
to the prince: &lsquo;Go in safety; this time you are forgiven,
because you gave me water in the cellar; but do not come
a second time if your life is dear to you.&rsquo; The poor prince
remained as if thunderstricken, then started and proceeded
a little way; but as he could not overcome his heart, he
returned to the dragon&rsquo;s palace. There he found the
empress weeping. When they saw each other and met,
they began to consult how to get away so as to escape.
Then said the prince to the empress: &lsquo;When the dragon
comes, ask him from whom he bought that horse, and tell
me, that I may obtain such another, that we may escape.&rsquo;
After saying this to her he went out, that the dragon might
not find him on his arrival. When the dragon came, the
empress began to coax him and make herself agreeable to
him, and said to him: &lsquo;What a swift horse yours is! From
whom did you buy him? Tell me, I pray you.&rsquo; He
answered: &lsquo;Where I bought him nobody can make a purchase.
On a certain hill lives an old woman who has twelve
horses in her stable, such that you don&rsquo;t know which is
better than another. One of them is in the corner, and
this one looks skinny; but he is the best of all, and is
brother of mine: this one could fly to the sky. Whoever
seeks to obtain a horse from the old woman must serve her
three days. The old woman has a mare with a foal; whoever
watches the mare successfully for three days, to him
the old woman gives the choice of whichever horse he
wishes. Whoever engages himself to watch the mare, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
fails to watch her successfully for three days and three
nights, loses his life.&rsquo; On the morrow the dragon went
away, and the prince came in. The empress told him what
the dragon had said. Then the prince started off and went
to the hill where the old woman was to be found. When
he entered her house, he said to her: &lsquo;Good-day, old
woman!&rsquo; The old woman replied: &lsquo;The Lord give you
prosperity, my son!&rsquo; She said to him: &lsquo;What brings you
here, my son?&rsquo; He replied: &lsquo;I should like to take service
with you.&rsquo; The old woman said to him: &lsquo;Very good, my
son. I have a mare with a foal. If you watch her successfully
for three days, I will give you one of these twelve
horses of mine to take away, whichever you choose; but if
you fail to watch her successfully, I shall take off your head.&rsquo;
Then she took him into the yard. In the yard post after
post was fixed in the ground, and on each was stuck a
human head; only one remained vacant, and this cried out
continually: &lsquo;Old woman, give me a head!&rsquo; When the old
woman had shown him all, she said: &lsquo;Know that all these
engaged to watch the mare and the foal, but were unable to
watch her successfully.&rsquo; But the prince was in no wise
terrified thereby. In the afternoon he mounted the mare
and galloped uphill and downhill, and the foal galloped
after her. Thus till midnight, and then, would he nould
he, sleep crept over him, and he fell asleep. When he woke
up at dawn his arms were round a stump instead of the
mare, but he held the halter in his hand. When he perceived
this, the poor fellow became dizzy from terror, and
started off to look for her; and while he was looking for her,
came to a sheet of water, and when he came to the water,
he remembered the little fish, unfolded the handkerchief, and
took out the scale and rubbed it between his fingers. Up
sprang the little fish out of the water, and lay before him.
&lsquo;What is the matter, adopted brother?&rsquo; said the fish. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
replied: &lsquo;The old woman&rsquo;s mare has escaped from me, and
I don&rsquo;t know where she is.&rsquo; The fish said to him: &lsquo;Here
she is amongst us; she has transformed herself into a fish,
and her foal into a little fish; but do you flap the halter on
the water, and call out: &ldquo;Coop! coop! old woman&rsquo;s mare!&rdquo;&rsquo;
He flapped the water with the halter, and called out: &lsquo;Coop!
coop! old woman&rsquo;s mare!&rsquo; and immediately she transformed
herself again into a mare, and, pop! there she was
on the brink of the water before him! He put the halter
on her and mounted her, and trot! trot! and at the old
woman&rsquo;s. When he brought her in, the old woman gave
him his dinner, but led the mare into the stable, scolded
her, and said: &lsquo;Among the fish, good-for-nothing rogue?&rsquo;
The mare replied: &lsquo;I was among the fish, but they told of
me, because they are his friends.&rsquo; The old woman said
to her: &lsquo;Go among the foxes.&rsquo; The second day he
mounted the mare, and galloped uphill and downhill, and
the foal galloped after. Thus till midnight. When it was
about midnight sleep overcame him, and he fell asleep upon
the mare&rsquo;s back. At dawn, when he awoke, his arms were
round a stump, but he held the halter in his hand. When
he perceived this, he sprang off again to seek her. As he
was seeking her, it came at once into his head what the old
woman had said to the mare when she was leading it into
the stable. Then he unwrapped the fox&rsquo;s hairs out of the
handkerchief, rubbed them between his fingers, and the fox
immediately jumped out before him. &lsquo;What is it, adopted
brother?&rsquo; He replied: &lsquo;The old woman&rsquo;s mare has run
away.&rsquo; The fox said to him: &lsquo;Here she is amongst us;
she has become a fox, and the foal a fox-cub. But do you
flap the ground with the halter, and call out: &ldquo;Coop! coop!
old woman&rsquo;s mare!&rdquo;&rsquo; He flapped and called, and the mare
leaped out before him. Then he caught her and put the
halter on her, mounted her, and rode to the old woman&rsquo;s.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
When he brought her home, the old woman gave him his
dinner, led the mare off to the stable, and said: &lsquo;Among the
foxes, good-for-nothing rogue?&rsquo; The mare replied: &lsquo;I was
among them, but they are his friends, and told of me.&rsquo;
The old woman said to her: &lsquo;Be among the crows.&rsquo; The
third day the prince again mounted the mare, and galloped
her uphill and downhill, and the foal galloped after. Thus
till midnight. About midnight he became sleepy, and fell
asleep, and woke up at dawn; but his arms were round a
stump, and he held the halter in his hand. As soon as he
perceived this, he darted off again to seek the mare, and as
he was seeking her, it came into his head what the old woman
had said the day before when scolding the mare. He took
out the handkerchief and unwrapped the crow&rsquo;s feathers,
rubbed them between his fingers, and, pop! the crow was
before him. &lsquo;What is it, adopted brother?&rsquo; The prince
replied: &lsquo;The old woman&rsquo;s mare has run away, and I don&rsquo;t
know where she is.&rsquo; The crow answered: &lsquo;Here she is
amongst us; she has become a crow, and the foal a young
crow. But flap the halter in the air, and cry: &ldquo;Coop! coop!
old woman&rsquo;s mare!&rdquo;&rsquo; He flapped the halter in the air, and
cried: &lsquo;Coop! coop! old woman&rsquo;s mare!&rsquo; and the mare
transformed herself from a crow into a mare, just as she had
been, and came before him. Then he put the halter on her,
and mounted her, and galloped off, the foal following behind,
to the old woman&rsquo;s. The old woman gave him his
dinner, caught the mare, led her into the stable, and said to
her: &lsquo;Among the crows, good-for-nothing rogue?&rsquo; The
mare replied: &lsquo;I was among them, but they are his friends,
and told of me.&rsquo; Then when the old woman came out, the
prince said to her: &lsquo;Well, old woman, I have served you
honestly; now I ask you to give me that which we agreed
upon.&rsquo; The old woman replied: &lsquo;My son, what is agreed
upon must be given. Here are twelve horses&mdash;choose
whichever you please.&rsquo; He replied: &lsquo;Why shall I pick and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
choose? Give me that one where he is in the corner;
there is none better in my eyes.&rsquo; Then the old woman
began to dissuade him: &lsquo;Why chose that skinny one when
there are so many good ones?&rsquo; He then insisted once for
all: &lsquo;Give me the one which I ask, for such was our agreement.&rsquo;
The old woman twisted, turned, and without more
ado gave him the one which he asked for. Then he
mounted it, and &lsquo;Farewell, old woman!&rsquo; &lsquo;Good-bye, my
son!&rsquo; When he took it to a wood and groomed it, it glittered
like gold. Afterwards, when he mounted it and gave
it its head, it flew, flew like a bird, and in a jiffy arrived at
the dragon&rsquo;s palace. As soon as he entered the courtyard,
he bade the empress to get ready for flight. She was not long
in getting ready; they both mounted the horse and set off.
They had not long started in flight when the dragon arrived&mdash;looked
about. No empress. Then he said to his horse:
&lsquo;Shall we eat and drink, or shall we pursue?&rsquo; &lsquo;Eat or not,
drink or not, pursue or not, you won&rsquo;t catch him.&rsquo; When
the dragon heard this, he immediately mounted his horse,
and started to pursue them. When the prince and empress
perceived that he was pursuing them, they were terrified,
and urged their horse to go quickly, but the horse answered
them: &lsquo;Never fear; there&rsquo;s no need to hurry.&rsquo; The dragon
came trot, trot, and the horse he rode called to that which
bore the prince and the empress: &lsquo;Bless you, brother,
wait! for I shall break my wind from pursuing you.&rsquo; The
other replied: &lsquo;Whose fault is it, if you&rsquo;re such a fool as to
carry that spectre on your back? Buck, and throw him on
the ground, and then follow me.&rsquo; When the dragon&rsquo;s horse
heard this, up with his head, a jump with his hind-quarters,
and bang went the dragon against a stone. The dragon
was smashed to pieces, and his horse followed the prince
and empress. Then the empress caught and mounted it,
and they arrived safe and sound in the empress&rsquo;s dominions,
and reigned honourably as long as they lived.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap39" id="chap39"></a>XXXIX.&mdash;THE LANGUAGE OF ANIMALS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A certain</span> man had a shepherd, who served him faithfully
and honestly for many years. This shepherd, when he was
once upon a time following the sheep, heard a whistling on
the hill, and, not knowing what it was, went off to see.
When he got to the place, there was a conflagration, and in
the middle of it a serpent was squeaking. When he saw this,
he waited to see how the serpent would act, for all around it
was burning, and the fire had almost come close to it.
When the serpent saw him, it screamed: &lsquo;Dear shepherd,
do a good action: take me out of this fire.&rsquo; The shepherd
took pity on its words, and reached it his crook, and it
crawled out upon it. When it had crawled out, it coiled
itself round his neck. When the shepherd saw this, he was
frightened, and said: &lsquo;Indeed you are a wretch! Is that
the way you are going to thank me for rescuing you? So
runs the proverb: &ldquo;Do good, and find evil.&rdquo;&rsquo; The serpent
answered him: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t fear: I shall do you no harm; only
carry me to my father; my father is the emperor of the
serpents.&rsquo; The shepherd begged pardon, and excused himself:
&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t carry you to your father, because I have no
one to leave in charge of my sheep.&rsquo; The serpent said to
him: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t fear for your sheep; nothing will happen to
them; only carry me to my father, and go quickly.&rsquo; Then
there was no help for it, so he started with it over the hill.
When he came to a door, which was formed of nothing but
serpents intertwined, and went up to it, the serpent which
was coiled round his neck gave a whistle, and the serpents,
which had twined themselves into the form of a door,
immediately untwined, and made way for them to enter.
As the shepherd and the serpent entered the palace, the
serpent called to the shepherd: &lsquo;Stop! let me tell you
something: when you come into my father&rsquo;s palace, he will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
promise you what you desire, silver and gold; but don&rsquo;t you
accept anything, only ask him to give you such a tongue
that you will be able to understand all animals. He will
not give you this readily, but at last grant it you he will.&rsquo;
The shepherd went with it into its father&rsquo;s palace, and its
father, on seeing it, shed tears, and asked it: &lsquo;Hey, my son,
where have you been till now?&rsquo; It replied, and told him
everything in order: what had taken place, and how it had
taken place, and how the shepherd had rescued it. Then
the emperor of the serpents turned to the shepherd, and
said to him: &lsquo;Come, my son, what do you wish me to give
you in recompense for rescuing my child?&rsquo; The shepherd
replied to him: &lsquo;Nothing else, only give me such a tongue
that I can understand all animals.&rsquo; The emperor of the
serpents said to him: &lsquo;That is not a proper gift for you, my
son, because, if I give you anything of the kind, you will
betray yourself in somebody&rsquo;s presence by boasting of it, and
then you will die immediately; ask something else.&rsquo; The
shepherd replied to him: &lsquo;I wish for nothing else. If you
will give it me, give it; if not, farewell!&rsquo; He turned to go;
but the emperor of the serpents cried out: &lsquo;Stay! Return!
If you ask this, come, that I may give it you. Open your
mouth.&rsquo; The shepherd opened his mouth, and the emperor
of the serpents spat into it, and told him to spit also into his
mouth. And thus they spat thrice into each other&rsquo;s mouths.
When this was done, the emperor of the serpents said to the
shepherd: &lsquo;Now you have the tongue which you desired;
go, and farewell! But it is not permitted you to tell anybody,
because, if you do, you will die. I am telling you the
truth.&rsquo; The shepherd then departed. As he went over the
hill, he understood the conversation of the birds, and, so to
speak, of everything in the world. When he came to his
sheep, he found them correct in number, and sat down to
rest. But scarcely had he lain down, when two crows flew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
up, perched on a tree hard by him, and began to converse
in their language: &lsquo;If that shepherd knew that just where
that black lamb lies a vault full of silver and gold is buried
in the ground, he would take its contents.&rsquo; When he heard
this, he went and told his master, and he brought a cart,
and they broke open the door of the vault, and took out its
valuable contents. His master was a righteous man, and said
to him: &lsquo;Well, my son, this is all yours; the Lord has given
it you. Go, provide a house, get married, and live comfortably.&rsquo;
The shepherd took the property, went away, provided a house,
got married, and lived very comfortably. This shepherd,
after a little time, became so rich and prosperous that there
was nobody richer than he in his own or the neighbouring
villages. He had shepherds, cowherds, swineherds, grooms,
and everything on a handsome scale. Once upon a time
this shepherd ordered his wife on New Year&rsquo;s Eve to provide
wine, brandy, and everything requisite, and to go the next
morning to his cattle, to take the provisions to the herdsmen,
that they, too, might enjoy themselves. His wife obeyed
him, and did as her husband ordered her.</p>

<p>The next day they got up, got ready, and went. When
they arrived where the cattle were, the master said to his
shepherds: &lsquo;Lads, assemble together, and sit down to eat
and drink your fill, and I will watch the cattle to-night.&rsquo;
This was done; they assembled together, and he went out
to sleep by the cattle. In the course of the night, after
some time, the wolves began to howl and speak in their
language, and the dogs to bark and speak in theirs. The
wolves said: &lsquo;Can we capture any young cattle?&rsquo; The
dogs answered in their language: &lsquo;Come in, that we, too,
may eat our fill of flesh.&rsquo; But among the dogs there was
one old dog, who had only two teeth left. This dog spoke
and answered the wolves: &lsquo;In faith, as long as these two
teeth of mine last, you shan&rsquo;t come near to do harm to my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
master.&rsquo; In the morning, when it dawned, the master
called the herdsmen, and told them to kill all the dogs except
that old one. His servants began to implore him:
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, master! Why? It&rsquo;s a sin.&rsquo; But he said to them:
&lsquo;Do just as I ordered you, and not otherwise.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he and his wife mounted their horses and went off.
His wife rode a mare, and he a horse. As they went, the
master&rsquo;s horse outstripped the wife&rsquo;s mare, and began to say
to her in their language: &lsquo;Go quicker; why do you hang
back?&rsquo; The mare&rsquo;s reply in defence of her lagging pace
was so amusing that the man laughed out loud, turned his
head, and looked behind him with a smile. His wife observed
him smiling, whipped her mare to catch him up, and
then asked him to tell her why he smiled. He said to her:
&lsquo;Well, suppose I did? Something came into my head.&rsquo;
This answer did not satisfy her, but she began to worry
him to tell her why he smiled. He said this and that to
her to get out of it, but the more he said to get out of it, the
more did she worry him. At length he said to her that, if
he told her, he would die immediately. But she had no
dread of her husband&rsquo;s dying, and went on worrying him:
&lsquo;There is no alternative, but tell me you must.&rsquo; When they
got home, they dismounted from their horses, and as soon
as they had done so, her husband ordered a grave to be dug
for him. It was dug, and he lay down in it, and said to his
wife: &lsquo;Did you not press me to tell you why I smiled?
Come now, that I may tell you; but I shall die immediately.&rsquo;
On saying this, he gave one more look round him,
and observed that the old dog had come from the cattle.
Seeing this, he told his wife to give him a piece of bread.
She gave it him, but the dog would not even look at it, but
shed tears and wept; but the cock, seeing it, ran up and
began to peck it. The dog was angry, and said: &lsquo;As if
<em>you&rsquo;d</em> die hungry! Don&rsquo;t you see that our master is going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
to die?&rsquo; &lsquo;What a fool he is! Let him die! Whose fault
is it? I have a hundred wives. When I find a grain of
millet, I call them all to me, and finally eat it myself. If
one of them gets cross at this, I give her one or two pecks,
and she lowers her tail; but this man isn&rsquo;t equal to keeping
one in order.&rsquo; When the man heard the cock say this, he
jumped up at once out of the grave, seized a stick, chased
his wife over hill and dale, and at last settled her completely,
so that it never entered her head any more to ask him why
he smiled.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Serbian is the most widely spread of the South
Slavonic dialects, being spoken not only in Serbia
proper, but also in Bosnia, Herzegovina, Croatia, Carniola,
and a great part of South Hungary. It has, like the Bulgarian,
been affected by the old Thracian language, but not to the
same extent. The infinitive is very frequently represented
by <i>da</i> with the finite verb. Szafarzik includes the whole of
the South Slavonic dialects, except the Bulgarian, under the
common name &lsquo;Illyrian,&rsquo; and subdivides them into the
three divisions of Serbian, Croatian, and Carinthian-Slovenish.</p>

<p>The Serbian stories are generally good, particularly
<a href="#chap40">No. 40</a>, which may be compared with a very inferior variant
in Grimm, &lsquo;The Golden Bird.&rsquo; <a href="#chap40">No. 40</a> is one of the
stories, the beauty of which set me to work upon the present
series of translations. In it is to be noticed the <i>pobratimstvo</i>,
or adoptive brotherhood, which plays so important
a part in Serbian life, and of which we have just had a
glimpse in the Bulgarian story, <a href="#chap38">No. 38</a>. <a href="#chap43">No. 43</a> is a very
good story, containing novel and interesting incidents. In
<a href="#chap44">No. 44</a> it must be observed that &lsquo;Fate&rsquo; is represented as a
man, for the converse reason to that for which Death is
represented as a woman in the Moravian story, <a href="#chap08">No 8</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>
<i>Usud</i> (Fate) is masculine, while <i>Smrt</i> (Death) is feminine
in Slavonic.</p>

<p>The Serbs possess actual epic poetry, of which an account
is given by Mr. Morfill (&lsquo;Slavonic Literature,&rsquo; pp. 154-162).</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap40" id="chap40"></a>XL.&mdash;THE LAME FOX.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a man who had three sons&mdash;two intelligent, and
one a simpleton. This man&rsquo;s right eye was always laughing,
while his left eye was weeping and shedding tears. This
man&rsquo;s sons agreed to go to him one by one, and ask him
why his right eye laughed and his left eye shed tears.</p>

<p>Accordingly the eldest went to his father by himself, and
asked him: &lsquo;Father, tell me truly what I am going to ask
you. Why does your right eye always laugh and your left
eye weep?&rsquo; His father gave him no answer, but flew into a
rage, seized a knife, and at him, and he fled out of doors,
and the knife stuck in the door. The other two were
outside, anxiously expecting their brother, and when he
came out, asked him what his father had said to him. But
he answered them: &lsquo;If you&rsquo;re not wiser than another, go,
and you will hear.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the middle brother went to his father by himself,
and asked him: &lsquo;Father, tell me truly what I am going to
ask you. Why does your right eye always laugh and your
left weep?&rsquo; His father gave him no answer, but flew into a
rage, seized a knife, and at him, and he fled out of doors,
and the knife stuck in the door. When he came out to his
brothers, his brothers asked him: &lsquo;Tell us, brother&mdash;so
may health and prosperity attend you!&mdash;what our father has
said to you.&rsquo; He answered them: &lsquo;If you&rsquo;re not wiser than
another, go, and you will hear.&rsquo; But this he said to his
elder brother on account of the simpleton, that he, too, might
go to his father to hear and see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span>
Then the simpleton, too, went by himself to his father,
and asked him: &lsquo;Father, my two brothers won&rsquo;t tell me
what you have said to them; tell me why your right eye
always laughs and your left eye weeps?&rsquo; His father immediately
flew into a rage, seized a knife, and brandished the
knife to pierce him through; but as he was standing, so he
remained standing where he was, and wasn&rsquo;t frightened in
the least. When his father saw that, he came to him, and
said: &lsquo;Well, you&rsquo;re my true son, I will tell you; but those
two are cowards. The reason why my right eye laughs is,
that I rejoice and am glad because you children obey and
serve me well. And why my left eye weeps, it weeps on
this account: I had in my garden a vine, which poured
forth a bucket of wine every hour, thus producing me
twenty-four buckets of wine every day and night. This vine
has been stolen from me, and I have not been able to find
it, nor do I know who has taken it or where it is. And for
this reason my left eye weeps, and will weep till I die, unless
I find it.&rsquo; When the simpleton came out of doors, his
brothers asked him what his father had said, and he told
them all in order.</p>

<p>Then they prepared a drinking bout for their father and
the domestics, and set out on their journey. On the
journey they came to a cross-road, and three ways lay before
them. The two elder consulted together, and said to their
youngest brother, the simpleton: &lsquo;Come, brother, let us
each choose a road, and let each go by himself and seek his
fortune.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, brothers,&rsquo; answered the simpleton; &lsquo;you
choose each a road; I will take that which remains to me.&rsquo;
The two elder took two roads which ran into each other,
started on their way, and afterwards met, came out into the
road, and said: &lsquo;Praise be to God that we&rsquo;re quit of that
fool!&rsquo; They then sat down to take their dinner. Scarcely
had they sat down to eat, when up came a lame she-fox on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>207]</a></span>
three legs, which approached them, fawning and begging to
obtain something to eat. But as soon as they saw the fox:
&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a fox,&rsquo; said they; &lsquo;come, let us kill it.&rsquo; Then, stick
in hand, and after it. The fox limped away in the best
fashion it could, and barely escaped from them. Meanwhile,
shepherd-dogs came to their wallet and ate up everything
that they had. When they returned to the wallet they
had a sight to see.</p>

<p>The simpleton took the third road right on, and went
forward till he began to feel hungry. Then he sat down on
the grass under a pear-tree, and took bread and bacon out
of his wallet to eat. Scarcely had he sat down to eat, when,
lo! that very same lame fox which his two brothers had
seen began to approach him, and to fawn and beg, limping on
three feet. He had compassion on it because it was so
lame, and said: &lsquo;Come, fox, I know that you are hungry,
and that it is hard lines for you that you have not a fourth
foot.&rsquo; He gave it bread and bacon to eat, a portion for
himself, and a portion for the fox. When they had refreshed
themselves a little, the fox said to him: &lsquo;But,
brother, tell me the truth: whither are you going?&rsquo; He
said: &lsquo;Thus and thus: I have a father and us three
brothers; and one of my father&rsquo;s eyes always laughs, because
we serve him well, and the other eye weeps, because there
has been stolen from him a vine belonging to him, which
poured forth a bucket of wine every hour; and now I am
going to ask people all over the world whether someone
cannot inform me about this vine, that I may obtain it for
my father, that his eye may not weep any longer.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The fox said: &lsquo;Well, I know where the vine is; follow
me.&rsquo; He followed the fox, and they came to a large garden.
Then the fox said: &lsquo;There is the vine of which you are in
search; but it is difficult to get to it. Do you now mark
well what I am going to say to you. In the garden, before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
the vine is reached, it is necessary to pass twelve watches,
and in each watch twelve warders. When the warders are
looking, you can pass them freely, because they sleep with
their eyes open. If they have their eyes closed, go not, for
they are awake, not sleeping, with their eyes closed. When
you come into the garden, there under the vine stand two
shovels&mdash;one of wood, and the other of gold. But mind you
don&rsquo;t take the golden shovel to dig up the vine, for the
shovel will ring, and will wake up the watch; the watch will
seize you, and you may fare badly. But take the wooden
shovel, and with it dig up the vine, and, when the watch is
looking, come quietly to me outside, and you will have
obtained the vine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He went into the garden, arrived at the first watch; the
warders directed their eyes towards him; one would have
thought they would have looked him to powder. But he
went past them as past a stone, came to the second, third,
and all the watches in succession, and arrived in the garden
at the vine itself. The vine poured forth a bucket of wine
every hour. He was too lazy to dig with the wooden shovel,
but took the golden one, and as soon as he struck it into
the ground, the shovel rang and woke the watch; the watch
assembled, seized him, and delivered him to their lord.</p>

<p>The lord asked the simpleton: &lsquo;How did you dare to
pass so many watches, and come into the garden to take my
vine away?&rsquo; The simpleton said: &lsquo;It is not your vine, but
my father&rsquo;s; and my father&rsquo;s left eye weeps, and will weep
till I obtain him the vine, and I must do it; and if you
don&rsquo;t give me my father&rsquo;s vine, I shall come again, and the
second time I shall take it away.&rsquo; The lord said: &lsquo;I cannot
give you the vine. But if you procure me the golden apple-tree
which blooms, ripens, and bears golden fruit every
twenty-four hours, I will give it you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He went out to the fox, and the fox asked him: &lsquo;Well,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
how is it?&rsquo; He answered: &lsquo;No how. I went past the watch,
and began to dig up the vine with the wooden shovel; but
it was too long a job, and I took the golden shovel; the
shovel rang and woke the watch; the watch seized me, and
delivered me to their lord, and the lord promised to give me
the vine, if I procured him the golden apple-tree which,
every twenty-four hours, blooms, ripens, and bears golden
fruit.&rsquo; The fox said: &lsquo;But why did you not obey me?
You see how nice it would have been to go to your father
with the vine.&rsquo; He shook his head: &lsquo;I see that I have
done wrong; but I will do so no more.&rsquo; The fox said:
&lsquo;Come! now let us go to the golden apple-tree.&rsquo; The fox
led him to a far handsomer garden than the first one, and
told him that he must pass similarly through twelve similar
watches. &lsquo;And when you come in the garden,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;to
where the golden apple-tree is, two very long poles stand
there&mdash;one of gold, and the other of wood. Don&rsquo;t take the
golden one to beat the golden apple-tree, for the golden branch
will emit a whistling sound, and will wake the watch, and
you will fare ill; but take the wooden pole to beat the golden
apple-tree, and then mind you come out immediately to me.
If you do not obey me, I will not help you further.&rsquo; He
said: &lsquo;I will, fox, only that it may be mine to acquire the
golden apple-tree to purchase the vine; I am impatient to
go to my father.&rsquo; He went into the garden, and the fox
stayed waiting for him outside. He passed the twelve
watches, and also arrived at the apple-tree. But when he saw
the apple-tree, and the golden apples on the apple-tree, he
forgot for joy where he was, and hastily took the golden pole
to beat the golden apple-tree. As soon as he had stripped a
golden branch with the pole, the golden branch emitted a
whistling sound, and woke the watch; the watch hastened
up, seized and delivered him to the lord of the golden
apple-tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
The lord asked the simpleton: &lsquo;How did you dare, and
how were you able, to go into my garden in face of so many
watches of mine, to beat the golden apple-trees?&rsquo; The
simpleton said: &lsquo;Thus and thus: my father&rsquo;s left eye weeps
because a vine has been stolen from him, which poured forth
a bucket of wine every hour. That vine is kept in such and
such a garden, and the lord of the garden and the vine said
to me: &ldquo;If you procure me the golden apple-tree which,
every twenty-four hours, blooms, ripens, and produces
golden fruit, I will give you the vine.&rdquo; And, therefore, I
have come to beat the golden apple-tree, to give the apple-tree
for the vine, and to carry the vine to my father, that his
left eye may not weep. And if you do not give me the
golden apple-tree now, I shall come again to steal it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The lord said: &lsquo;It is good, if it is so. Go you and procure
me the golden horse which, in twenty-four hours, goes
over the world, and I will give you the golden apple-tree;
give the apple-tree for the vine, and take the vine to your
father, that he may weep no more.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he went outside, and the fox, awaiting him, said:
&lsquo;Now, then; how is it?&rsquo; &lsquo;Not very well. The golden
apple-trees are so beautiful that you can&rsquo;t look at them for
beauty. I forgot myself, and couldn&rsquo;t take the wooden
pole, as you told me, but took the golden pole to beat the
golden apple-tree; the branch emitted a whistling sound,
and woke the watch; the watch seized me, and delivered
me to their lord, and the lord told me, if I procured him the
golden horse which goes over the world in twenty-four
hours, he would give me the golden apple-tree, that I may
give the apple-tree for the vine to take to my father, that he
may weep no more.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Again the fox began to scold and reproach him: &lsquo;Why
did you not obey me? You see that you would have been
by now at your father&rsquo;s. And thus you torment both yourself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
and me.&rsquo; He said to the fox: &lsquo;Only procure me the horse,
fox, and I will always henceforth obey you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The fox led him to a large and horrible forest, and in the
forest they found a farmyard. In this farmyard twelve
watches, as in the case of the vine and the apple-tree,
guarded the golden horse. The fox said: &lsquo;Now you will
pass the watches as before; go if they are looking; do not
go if they have their eyes shut. When you enter the stable,
there stands the golden horse, equipped with golden trappings.
By the horse are two bridles&mdash;one of gold, and the
other plaited of tow. Mind you don&rsquo;t take the golden bridle,
but the one of tow; if you bridle him with the golden bridle,
the horse will neigh and will wake the watch; the watch will
seize you, and who will be worse off than you? Don&rsquo;t
come into my sight without the horse!&rsquo; &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t, fox,&rsquo;
said he, and went. He passed all the watches, and entered
the stable where the horse was. When he was there, golden
horse! golden wings! so beautiful, good heavens! that you
couldn&rsquo;t look at them for beauty! He saw the golden
bridle; it was beautiful and ornamented; he saw also that
of tow; it was dirty, and couldn&rsquo;t be worse. Now he
thought long what to do and how to do. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t put that
nasty thing&rsquo; (the tow bridle)&mdash;&lsquo;it&rsquo;s so nasty!&mdash;on that
beauty; I had rather not have him at all than put such a
horse to shame.&rsquo; He took the golden bridle, bridled the
golden horse, and mounted him. But the horse neighed,
and woke the watch; the watch seized him and delivered
him to their lord.</p>

<p>Then the lord said: &lsquo;How did you have resolution to
pass my numerous warders into my stable to take away my
golden horse?&rsquo; The simpleton replied: &lsquo;Need drove me;
I have a father at home, and his left eye continually weeps,
and will weep till I obtain for him a vine which in a day
and night poured forth twenty-four buckets of wine; this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
vine has been stolen from him. Well, I have found it, and
it has been told me that I shall obtain the vine if I procure
the golden apple-tree for the lord of the vine. And the
lord of the golden apple-tree said if I procured him the
golden horse, he would give me the golden apple-tree. And
I came from him to take away the golden horse, that I
might give the golden horse for the golden apple-tree, and
the golden apple-tree for the vine, to take it home and give
it my father, that he may weep no more.&rsquo; The lord said:
&lsquo;Good; if it is so, I will give you my golden horse, if you
procure me the golden damsel in her cradle, who has never
yet seen either the sun or the moon, so that her face is not
tanned.&rsquo; And the simpleton said: &lsquo;I will procure you the
golden damsel, but you must give me your golden horse, on
which to seek the golden damsel and bring her to you. And
a golden horse properly appertains to a golden damsel.&rsquo;
The lord: &lsquo;And how will you guarantee that you will
return to me again?&rsquo; The simpleton: &lsquo;Behold, I swear
to you by my father&rsquo;s eyesight, that I will return to you
again, and either bring the horse, if I do not find the damsel,
or give you the damsel, if I find her, for the horse.&rsquo; To
this the lord agreed, and gave him the golden horse; he
bridled it with the golden bridle, and came outside to the
fox. The fox was impatiently expecting him, to know what
had happened.</p>

<p>The fox: &lsquo;Well, have you obtained the horse?&rsquo; The
simpleton: &lsquo;I have, but on condition that I procure for
him the golden damsel in her cradle, who has never yet
seen the sun or the moon, so that her face is not tanned.
But if you know what need is, good friend, in the
world, say whether she is anywhere, and whether you
know of such a damsel.&rsquo; The fox said: &lsquo;I know where
the damsel is; only follow me.&rsquo; He followed, and they
came to a large cavern. Now the fox said: &lsquo;There the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
damsel is. You will go into that cavern, deep into the
earth. You will pass the watches as before. In the last
chamber lies the golden damsel in a golden cradle. By the
damsel stands a huge spectre, which says: &ldquo;No! No! No!&rdquo;
Now, don&rsquo;t be at all afraid; it cannot do anything to you in
any wise; but her wicked mother has placed it beside her
daughter, that no one may venture to approach her to take
her away. And the damsel is impatiently waiting to be
released and freed from her mother&rsquo;s cruelty. When you
come back with the damsel in the cradle, push all the doors
to behind you, that they may be shut, that the watch may
not be able to come out after you in pursuit.&rsquo; He did so.
He passed all the watches, entered the last chamber, and in
the chamber was the damsel, rocking herself in a golden
cradle, and on the way to the cradle stood a huge spectre,
which said: &lsquo;No! No! No!&rsquo; But he paid no attention to
it. He took the cradle in his hands, seated himself with
the cradle on the horse, and proceeded, pushed the doors
to, and the doors closed from the first to the last, and out
he flew with the damsel in the cradle before the fox. The
fox was anxiously expecting him.</p>

<p>Now the fox said to him: &lsquo;Are you not sorry to give so
beautiful a damsel for the golden horse? But you will not
otherwise be able to acquire the golden horse, because you
have sworn by your father&rsquo;s eyesight. But come! let me
try whether I can&rsquo;t be the golden damsel.&rsquo; She bounded
hither and thither, and transformed herself into a golden
damsel; everything about her was damsel-like, only her
eyes were shaped like a fox&rsquo;s eyes. He put her into the
golden cradle, and left the real damsel under a tree to take
charge of the golden horse. He went, he took away the
golden cradle, and in the cradle the fox-damsel, delivered
her to the lord of the golden horse, and absolved himself
from the oath by his father&rsquo;s eyesight. He returned to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
horse and the damsel. Now that same lord of the golden
horse, full of joy at acquiring the golden damsel, assembled
all his lordship, prepared a grand banquet for their entertainment,
and showed them what he had acquired in
exchange for his golden horse. While the guests were
gazing at the damsel, one of them scrutinized her attentively,
and said: &lsquo;All is damsel-like, and she is very beautiful, but
her eyes are shaped like a fox&rsquo;s eyes.&rsquo; No sooner had he
said this, when up sprang the fox and ran away. The lord
and the guests were enraged that he had said &lsquo;fox&rsquo;s eyes,&rsquo;
and put him to death.</p>

<p>The fox ran to the simpleton, and on they went to give
the golden horse for the golden apple-tree. They arrived at
the place. Here again the fox said: &lsquo;Now, you see, you
have got possession of the golden damsel, but the golden
horse properly appertains to the golden damsel. Are you
sorry to give the golden horse?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, fox; but though I
am sorry, yet I wish my father not to weep.&rsquo; The fox:
&lsquo;But stay; let me try whether I can be the golden horse.&rsquo;
She bounded hither and thither, and transformed herself
into a golden horse, only she had a fox&rsquo;s tail. Then she
said: &lsquo;Now lead me; let them give you the golden apple-tree,
and I know when I shall come to you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He led off the fox-horse, delivered it to the lord of the
golden apple-tree, and obtained the golden apple-tree. Now,
the lord of the golden apple-tree was delighted at having
acquired so beautiful a horse, and invited his whole lordship
to a feast, to boast to them what a horse he had acquired.
The guests began to gaze at the horse, and to wonder how
beautiful he was. All at once one scrutinized his tail attentively,
and said: &lsquo;All is beautiful and all pleases me, only
I should say that it is a fox&rsquo;s tail!&rsquo; The moment he said
that, the fox jumped up and ran away. But the guests were
enraged at him for using the expression &lsquo;fox&rsquo;s tail,&rsquo; and put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
him to death. The fox came to the simpleton, and proceeded
with the golden damsel, the horse, and the golden
apple-tree to the vine.</p>

<p>Now again the fox said: &lsquo;You see, now you have acquired
the golden apple-tree. But the golden damsel is not appropriate
without the golden horse, or the golden horse without
the golden apple-tree. Are you sorry to give the golden
apple-tree?&rsquo; The simpleton: &lsquo;Yes, fox; but I must, to
obtain the vine, that my father may not weep. I had rather
that my father did not weep than all that I have.&rsquo; The fox
said: &lsquo;Stay! I will try whether I can be the golden apple-tree.&rsquo;
She bounded hither and thither, and transformed
herself into a golden apple-tree, and told him to take it
away and give it for the vine. He took off the golden fox-apple-tree,
and gave it to the lord of the vine, obtained the
vine, and went away.</p>

<p>The lord for joy assembled his whole lordship, and prepared
a grand feast, to display what a golden apple-tree he
had acquired. The guests assembled and began to gaze at
the apple-tree. But one scrutinized it attentively, and said:
&lsquo;All is beautiful, and cannot be more beautiful, only the
fruit is in shape a fox&rsquo;s head, and not like other apples.&rsquo;
No sooner had he said this when up jumped the fox and
ran away. But they were enraged at him and slew him,
because he had said &lsquo;fox&rsquo;s head.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now the simpleton took leave of the fox and went home,
having with him the golden damsel, the golden horse, the
golden apple-tree, and the vine. When he arrived at the cross-road,
where he had parted from his brothers when he went
from home to seek the vine, he saw a multitude of people
assembled, and he, too, went thither to see what was the
matter. When he got there, his two brothers were standing
condemned, and the people were going to hang them. He
told the damsel that they were his brothers, and that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
would like to ransom them. The damsel took a large quantity
of treasure out of her bosom, and he ransomed his
brothers, the malefactors, who had thought to acquire the
vine by slaying, burning, and plundering. They envied
him, but could not help themselves. They proceeded
home. The simpleton planted the vine in the garden where
it had been; the vine began to pour forth wine, and his
father&rsquo;s left eye ceased to weep and began to laugh. The
apple-tree began to blossom, the golden horse to neigh, the
damsel to sing, and there was love and beauty at the farmhouse.
Everything was merry, everything was rejoicing and
making progress.</p>

<p>All at once the father sent his sons to bring him from
the country three ears of rye, that he might see what manner
of season it would be. When they came to a well in the
country, they told their simpleton brother to get them some
water to drink. He stooped over the well to reach the
water for them; they pushed him into the water and he
was drowned. Immediately the vine ceased to pour forth
wine, the father&rsquo;s eye began to weep, the apple-tree drooped,
the horse ceased to neigh, the damsel began to weep, and
everything lost its cheerful appearance. Thereupon that
self-same lame fox came up, got down into the well, gently
drew her adopted brother out, poured the water out of him,
placed him on the fresh grass, and he revived. As soon
as he revived the fox was transformed into a very beautiful
damsel. Then she related to him how her mother had
cursed her because she had rescued her greatest enemy
from death. She was cursed, and was transformed into a
cunning fox, and limped on three feet until she should
rescue her benefactor from a watery death. &lsquo;And, lo! I
have rescued you, my adopted brother. Now, adieu!&rsquo; She
went her way, and the simpleton his way to his father, and
when he arrived at the farmhouse the vine began again to pour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>217]</a></span>
forth wine, his father&rsquo;s eye to laugh [the golden apple-tree
to bloom], the golden horse to neigh, and the golden damsel
to sing. He told his father what his brothers had done to
him on the way, and how a damsel had rescued him and
freed herself from a curse. When his father heard this he
drove the two villains into the world. But he married the
simpleton to the golden damsel, with whom he lived long in
happiness and content.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap41" id="chap41"></a>XLI.&mdash;THE SONS&rsquo; OATH TO THEIR DYING FATHER.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was an old man who had three sons and one
daughter. When the time came for the old man to die, he
summoned all his three sons, and made them promise under
oath to give their sister to the first who came to ask for her,
whoever he might be. When some time had elapsed after
the father&rsquo;s death, an old man arrived in a two-wheeler, and
asked for the maiden in marriage. The two elder brothers
would not give her to him immediately, because he was old
and poor; but the youngest insisted that they should give
her to him, reminding them of the oath they had sworn to
their father. And so they gave her in marriage to the old
man, and the old man took her away to his home. After
some time, the elder brother went on a visit to his sister.
When he got there, it was a large house, and couldn&rsquo;t be
better. The sister was greatly delighted when she saw her
brother, and when he inquired of her how she was getting
on, she replied: &lsquo;Excellently; it can&rsquo;t be better.&rsquo; When
the brother arrived at his sister&rsquo;s, the old man was not at
home, but soon afterwards arrived, and was very pleased
when he saw his wife&rsquo;s brother, and said to him: &lsquo;We will
feast and be merry; but first you shall go on my horse to
fetch him some grass, but you must cut it where the horse
paws with his foot, and not where you please.&rsquo; His wife&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>218]</a></span>
brother said to him: &lsquo;Good! brother-in-law, I will.&rsquo; He
then mounted the horse and went off. As on he went, he
came to a silver bridge. When he espied the bridge and
saw that it was all of silver, he became covetous, dismounted,
and pulled off a silver plate, saying: &lsquo;I may
benefit myself.&rsquo; Afterwards he cut grass where he pleased,
without waiting till the horse pawed with his foot, mounted
the horse again, and returned back. On arriving at the
house, he put the horse in the stable, placed the grass before
him, and went off into the house. When he arrived in the
house, the old man asked him whether he had satisfied the
horse, and whether the horse was eating the grass. He
replied, &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; and that the horse was eating. The old man
said: &lsquo;It is good that I also look.&rsquo; He then went into the
stable. When he got there, the horse had not touched it.
The old man understood that the grass had not been cut
where he had told him; he therefore at once sent off his
brother-in-law supperless, to go back whence he had come.
On reaching home, he didn&rsquo;t tell his brothers how he had
fared at his brother-in-law&rsquo;s, but said to the middle brother:
&lsquo;Our brother-in-law salutes you, and wishes you to go to be
his guest.&rsquo; After some time, the middle brother went on a
visit to his sister; but he, too, fared even as the first one.
His sister&rsquo;s husband sent him, too, for grass, and when he
got to the silver bridge, he, too, became covetous, like the
first, pulled off a silver plate, and did not cut the grass as
his brother-in-law told him, but where he thought fit. When
he came back to his brother-in-law&rsquo;s house, his brother-in-law
caught him, too, out in a lie, and sent him home supperless,
like the first one. When he got home, he told nobody how
he had fared at his brother-in-law&rsquo;s, but said to the youngest
brother: &lsquo;Our brother-in-law salutes you, and wishes you to
go to visit him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>After some time, the youngest brother, too, went off.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
When his sister espied him, she said to him: &lsquo;Only,
brother, be sure not to do as our two brothers have done.&rsquo;
He didn&rsquo;t know what they had done, and his sister would
not tell him anything more. When his sister&rsquo;s husband
came home, he, too, was delighted with his wife&rsquo;s brother,
and said to him: &lsquo;We will feast and be merry, only go first
on my horse and fetch him some grass; but you will cut it
there where the horse paws with his foot, and not where you
please.&rsquo; He mounted the horse and went off for the grass.
When he arrived at the bridge, he was astonished at its
beauty, but was quite sorry that it hadn&rsquo;t those two plates;
and when he came to the middle, he looked on one side
and the other, and saw under it, where water was bubbling
in a huge caldron, and human heads boiling in it, and
eagles pecking them from above. Afterwards, having passed
over the bridge, he came to a village, and, as he passed
through it, saw that there everything was sad and sorrowful,
and wondered thereat, and asked a man: &lsquo;How is this,
brother, that all is so sorrowful with you?&rsquo; He replied:
&lsquo;How should it not be sorrowful, when hail smites us every
hour, and we have nothing.&rsquo; When he came out of the
village, he found two pigs on the road, and they were fighting
without ceasing. He tried to part them, but in vain,
and, being unable to part them, went on further. Thus
proceeding, he came to another village, and, as he went
through, heard on all sides singing and merriment, and said
to someone: &lsquo;I went through one village and found everything
sorrowful, and why is all so merry with you?&rsquo; The
villager answered him: &lsquo;Why should it not be so, when
every hour is productive to us, and we have all in abundance?&rsquo;
Finally, the horse carried him to a very beautiful
meadow. When they were in the middle of the meadow,
the horse stood still and pawed with his foot, and he dismounted
and cut grass, and returned back to the house.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
When he got to the house, he led the horse into the stable,
laid the grass before him, and the horse immediately began
to eat. When his sister&rsquo;s husband saw that he had satisfied
the horse, he was very pleased, and said to him: &lsquo;You are
my true brother-in-law; now let us be merry and feast.&rsquo;
Then they sat down to table and began to sup. At supper
the old man said to him: &lsquo;Now, tell me what you have
seen.&rsquo; He answered him: &lsquo;Oh, my brother-in-law! what I
have seen cannot be expressed. First I saw a very beautiful
silver bridge, but it was disfigured where it wanted a pair of
plates. Whoever took these away, the living God hath slain
him!&rsquo; The old man thereupon told him: &lsquo;Your two
brothers stole them. As they have done, so have they fared.
But tell me what you saw next.&rsquo; His wife&rsquo;s brother
replied: &lsquo;At the middle under the bridge I saw a huge
caldron, where it was bubbling, and in it the heads of dead
people, and eagles were pecking them from above.&rsquo; Thereupon
his sister&rsquo;s husband said: &lsquo;Those are the eternal
torments in that world. What did you see more?&rsquo; His
wife&rsquo;s brother continued: &lsquo;I saw a village, and in it everything
miserable.&rsquo; The old man said to him: &lsquo;There there
is no union and no truth, nor knowledge of God. What did
you see further?&rsquo; His wife&rsquo;s brother said to him further:
&lsquo;I saw two pigs fighting without ceasing.&rsquo; His sister&rsquo;s
husband replied: &lsquo;Those are two brothers who do not live
in concord. What did you see further?&rsquo; &lsquo;I saw another
village, and in it all was cheerful.&rsquo; His sister&rsquo;s husband
said to that: &lsquo;Those are people after God&rsquo;s will; they
gladly welcome and entertain everybody, and do not drive
the poor empty-handed from before their houses. Tell me
what you saw further.&rsquo; His wife&rsquo;s brother said to him: &lsquo;I
saw a very beautiful meadow. I would stay there three
days to view such beauty.&rsquo; His sister&rsquo;s husband replied:
&lsquo;That is the paradise of that world, but it is difficult to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
attain to it.&rsquo; After this they enjoyed each other&rsquo;s society for
many days. Finally, the wife&rsquo;s brother declared that he
must go home, and his sister&rsquo;s husband presented him with
a large gift, and told him that he recognised him immediately
for an honourable man, because he had insisted that
his father&rsquo;s directions, which he had sworn to observe,
should be carried out, and that he would be prosperous, and
his two brothers unprosperous.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap42" id="chap42"></a>XLII.&mdash;THE WONDERFUL HAIR.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a man who was very poor, but so well supplied
with children that he was utterly unable to maintain them,
and one morning more than once prepared to kill them,
in order not to see their misery in dying from hunger, but
his wife prevented him. One night a child came to him in
his sleep, and said to him: &lsquo;Man! I see that you are
making up your mind to destroy and to kill your poor little
children, and I know that you are distressed thereat; but
in the morning you will find under your pillow a mirror, a
red kerchief, and an embroidered pocket-handkerchief; take
all three secretly and tell nobody; then go to such a hill;
by it you will find a stream; go along it till you come to its
fountain-head; there you will find a damsel as bright as the
sun, with her hair hanging down over her back, and without
a scrap of clothing. Be on your guard, that the ferocious
she-dragon do not coil round you; do not converse with
her if she speaks; for if you converse with her, she will
poison you, and turn you into a fish, or something else, and
will then devour you; but if she bids you examine her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
head, examine it, and as you turn over her hair, look, and
you will find one hair as red as blood; pull it out and run
back again; then, if she suspects and begins to run after
you, throw her first the embroidered pocket-handkerchief,
then the kerchief, and, lastly, the mirror; then she will find
occupation for herself. And sell that hair to some rich
man; but don&rsquo;t let them cheat you, for that hair is worth
countless wealth; and you will thus enrich yourself and
maintain your children.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the poor man awoke, he found everything under
his pillow, just as the child had told him in his sleep; and
then he went to the hill. When there, he found the stream,
went on and on alongside of it, till he came to the fountain-head.
Having looked about him to see where the damsel
was, he espied her above a piece of water, like sunbeams
threaded on a needle, and she was embroidering at a frame
on stuff, the threads of which were young men&rsquo;s hair. As
soon as he saw her, he made a reverence to her, and she
stood on her feet and questioned him: &lsquo;Whence are you,
unknown young man?&rsquo; But he held his tongue. She
questioned him again: &lsquo;Who are you? Why have you
come?&rsquo; and much else of all sorts; but he was as mute as a
stone, making signs with his hands, as if he were deaf and
wanted help. Then she told him to sit down on her skirt.
He did not wait for any more orders, but sat down, and
she bent down her head to him, that he might examine it.
Turning over the hair of her head, as if to examine it, he
was not long in finding that red hair, and separated it from
the other hair, pulled it out, jumped off her skirt and ran
away back as he best could. She noticed it, and ran at his
heels full speed after him. He looked round, and seeing that
she was about to overtake him, threw, as he was told,
the embroidered pocket-handkerchief on the way, and when
she saw the pocket-handkerchief, she stooped and began to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
overhaul it in every direction, admiring the embroidery,
till he had got a good way off. Then the damsel placed the
pocket-handkerchief in her bosom, and ran after him again.
When he saw that she was about to overtake him, he threw
the red kerchief, and she again occupied herself, admiring
and gazing, till the poor man had again got a good way off.
Then the damsel became exasperated, and threw both the
pocket-handkerchief and the kerchief on the way, and ran
after him in pursuit. Again, when he saw that she was
about to overtake him, he threw the mirror. When the
damsel came to the mirror, the like of which she had never
seen before, she lifted it up, and when she saw herself in it,
not knowing that it was herself, but thinking that it was
somebody else, she, as it were, fell in love with herself in the
mirror, and the man got so far off that she was no longer
able to overtake him. When she saw that she could not
catch him, she turned back, and the man reached his home
safe and sound. After arriving at his home, he showed his
wife the hair, and told her all that had happened to him,
but she began to jeer and laugh at him. But he paid no
attention to her, and went to a town to sell the hair. A
crowd of all sorts of people and merchants collected round
him; one offered a sequin, another two, and so on, higher and
higher, till they came to a hundred gold sequins. Just then
the emperor heard of the hair, summoned the man into his
presence, and said to him that he would give him a thousand
sequins for it, and he sold it to him. What was the hair?
The emperor split it in two from top to bottom, and found
registered in it in writing many remarkable things, which
had happened in the olden time since the beginning of the
world. Thus the man became rich and lived on with his wife
and children. And that child, that came to him in his
sleep, was an angel sent by the Lord God, whose will it was
to aid the poor man, and to reveal secrets which had not
been revealed till then.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap43" id="chap43"></a>XLIII.&mdash;THE DRAGON AND THE PRINCE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was an emperor who had three sons. One day the
eldest son went out hunting, and when he got outside the
town, up sprang a hare out of a bush, and he after it, and hither
and thither, till the hare fled into a water-mill, and the prince
after it. But it was not a hare, but a dragon, and it waited
for the prince and devoured him. When several days had
elapsed and the prince did not return home, people began
to wonder why it was that he was not to be found. Then
the middle son went hunting, and as he issued from the
town, a hare sprang out of a bush, and the prince after it,
and hither and thither, till the hare fled into the water-mill
and the prince after it; but it was not a hare, but a dragon,
which waited for and devoured him. When some days had
elapsed and the princes did not return, either of them, the
whole court was in sorrow. Then the third son went hunting,
to see whether he could not find his brothers. When
he issued from the town, again up sprang a hare out of a
bush, and the prince after it, and hither and thither, till the
hare fled into the water-mill. But the prince did not choose
to follow it, but went to find other game, saying to himself:
&lsquo;When I return I shall find you.&rsquo; After this he went for a
long time up and down the hill, but found nothing, and
then returned to the water-mill; but when he got there,
there was only an old woman in the mill. The prince invoked
God in addressing her: &lsquo;God help you, old woman!&rsquo;
The old woman replied: &lsquo;God help you, my son!&rsquo; Then
the prince asked her: &lsquo;Where, old woman, is my hare?&rsquo;
She replied: &lsquo;My son, that was not a hare, but a dragon.
It kills and throttles many people.&rsquo; Hearing this, the prince
was somewhat disturbed, and said to the old woman:
&lsquo;What shall we do now? Doubtless my two brothers also
have perished here.&rsquo; The old woman answered: &lsquo;They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
have indeed; but there&rsquo;s no help for it. Go home, my
son, lest you follow them.&rsquo; Then he said to her: &lsquo;Dear
old woman, do you know what? I know that you will be
glad to liberate yourself from that pest.&rsquo; The old woman
interrupted him: &lsquo;How should I not? It captured me,
too, in this way, but now I have no means of escape.&rsquo;
Then he proceeded: &lsquo;Listen well to what I am going to
say to you. Ask it whither it goes and where its strength
is; then kiss all that place where it tells you its strength is,
as if from love, till you ascertain it, and afterwards tell me
when I come.&rsquo; Then the prince went off to the palace, and
the old woman remained in the water-mill. When the
dragon came in, the old woman began to question it:
&lsquo;Where in God&rsquo;s name have you been? Whither do you go
so far? You will never tell me whither you go.&rsquo; The
dragon replied: &lsquo;Well, my dear old woman, I do go far.&rsquo;
Then the old woman began to coax it: &lsquo;And why do you
go so far? Tell me where your strength is. If I knew
where your strength is, I don&rsquo;t know what I should do for
love; I would kiss all that place.&rsquo; Thereupon the dragon
smiled and said to her: &lsquo;Yonder is my strength, in that
fireplace.&rsquo; Then the old woman began to fondle and kiss
the fireplace, and the dragon on seeing it burst into a laugh,
and said to her: &lsquo;Silly old woman, my strength isn&rsquo;t there;
my strength is in that tree-fungus in front of the house.&rsquo;
Then the old woman began again to fondle and kiss the
tree, and the dragon again laughed, and said to her: &lsquo;Away,
old woman! my strength isn&rsquo;t there.&rsquo; Then the old woman
inquired: &lsquo;Where is it?&rsquo; The dragon began to give an
account in detail: &lsquo;My strength is a long way off, and
you cannot go thither. Far in another empire under the
emperor&rsquo;s city is a lake, in that lake is a dragon, and in the
dragon a boar, and in the boar a pigeon, and in that is my
strength.&rsquo; The next morning when the dragon went away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
from the mill, the prince came to the old woman, and the
old woman told him all that she had heard from the dragon.
Then he left his home, and disguised himself; he put shepherd&rsquo;s
boots on his feet, took a shepherd&rsquo;s staff in his hand,
and went into the world. As he went on thus from village
to village, and from town to town, at last he came into
another empire and into the imperial city, in a lake under
which the dragon was. On going into the town, he began
to inquire who wanted a shepherd. The citizens told him
that the emperor did. Then he went straight to the
emperor. After he announced himself, the emperor admitted
him into his presence, and asked him: &lsquo;Do you
wish to keep sheep?&rsquo; He replied: &lsquo;I do, illustrious crown!&rsquo;
Then the emperor engaged him, and began to inform and
instruct him: &lsquo;There is here a lake, and alongside of the
lake very beautiful pasture, and when you call the sheep
out, they go thither at once, and spread themselves round
the lake; but whatever shepherd goes off there, that shepherd
returns back no more. Therefore, my son, I tell you,
don&rsquo;t let the sheep have their own way and go where <em>they</em>
will, but keep them where <em>you</em> will.&rsquo; The prince thanked
the emperor, got himself ready, and called out the sheep,
taking with him, moreover, two hounds that could catch a
boar in the open country, and a falcon that could capture
any bird, and carrying also a pair of bagpipes. When he
called out the sheep he let them go at once to the lake, and
when the sheep arrived at the lake, they immediately spread
round it, and the prince placed the falcon on a stump, and
the hounds and bagpipes under the stump, then tucked up
his hose and sleeves, waded into the lake, and began to
shout &lsquo;Dragon! dragon! come out to single combat with
me to-day that we may measure ourselves together, unless
you&rsquo;re a woman.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The dragon called out in reply, &lsquo;I will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
do so now, prince&mdash;now!&rsquo; Erelong, behold the dragon! it
is large, it is terrible, it is disgusting! When the dragon
came out, it seized him by the waist, and they wrestled a
summer day till afternoon. But when the heat of afternoon
came on, the dragon said: &lsquo;Let me go, prince, that I may
moisten my parched head in the lake, and toss you to the
sky.&rsquo; But the prince replied: &lsquo;Come, dragon, don&rsquo;t talk
nonsense; if I had the emperor&rsquo;s daughter to kiss me on
the forehead, I would toss you still higher.&rsquo; Thereupon the
dragon suddenly let go of him, and went off into the lake.
On the approach of evening, he washed and got himself up
nicely, placed the falcon on his arm, the hounds behind
him, and the bagpipes under his arm, then drove the sheep
and went into the town playing on the bagpipes. When he
arrived at the town, the whole town assembled as to see a
wondrous sight because he had come, whereas previously
no shepherd had been able to come from the lake. The
next day the prince got ready again, and went with his sheep
straight to the lake. But the emperor sent two grooms
after him to go stealthily and see what he did, and they
placed themselves on a high hill whence they could have a
good view. When the shepherd arrived, he put the hounds
and bagpipes under the stump and the falcon upon it, then
tucked up his hose and sleeves, waded into the lake and
shouted: &lsquo;Dragon, dragon! come out to single combat
with me, that we may measure ourselves once more together,
unless you are a woman!&rsquo; The dragon replied: &lsquo;I will do
so, prince; now, now!&rsquo; Erelong, behold the dragon! it was
large, it was terrible, it was disgusting! And it seized him
by the waist and wrestled with him a summer&rsquo;s day till
afternoon. But when the afternoon heat came on, the
dragon said: &lsquo;Let me go, prince, that I may moisten my
parched head in the lake, and may toss you to the sky.&rsquo;
The prince replied: &lsquo;Come, dragon, don&rsquo;t talk nonsense;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
if I had the emperor&rsquo;s daughter to kiss me on the forehead,
I would toss you still higher.&rsquo; Thereupon the dragon suddenly
left hold of him, and went off into the lake. When
night approached the prince drove the sheep as before, and
went home playing the bagpipes. When he arrived at the
town, the whole town was astir and began to wonder because
the shepherd came home every evening, which no one
had been able to do before. Those two grooms had already
arrived at the palace before the prince, and related to the
emperor in order everything that they had heard and seen.
Now when the emperor saw that the shepherd returned
home, he immediately summoned his daughter into his
presence and told her all, what it was and how it was.
&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;to-morrow you must go with the shepherd
to the lake and kiss him on the forehead.&rsquo; When she heard
this she burst into tears and began to entreat her father.
&lsquo;You have no one but me, and I am your only daughter,
and you don&rsquo;t care about me if I perish.&rsquo; Then the emperor
began to persuade and encourage her: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t fear,
my daughter; you see, we have had so many changes of
shepherds, and of all that went out to the lake not one has
returned; but <em>he</em> has been contending with the dragon for
two whole days and it has done him no hurt. I assure you,
in God&rsquo;s name, that he is able to overcome the dragon, only
go to-morrow with him to see whether he will free us from
this mischief which has destroyed so many people.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_15_15">[15]</a></span>
This is intended as an insult. &lsquo;Azhdaja,&rsquo; a dragon, is feminine in
Servian.</p>
</div>

<p>When, on the morrow, the day dawned, the day dawned
and the sun came forth, up rose the shepherd, up rose the
maiden too, to begin to prepare for going to the lake. The
shepherd was cheerful, more cheerful than ever, but the
emperor&rsquo;s daughter was sad, and shed tears. The shepherd
comforted her: &lsquo;Lady sister, I pray you, do not weep, but
do what I tell you. When it is time, run up and kiss me,
and fear not.&rsquo; As he went and drove the sheep, the shepherd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
was thoroughly cheery, and played a merry tune on his
bagpipes; but the damsel did nothing but weep as she went
beside him, and he several times left off playing and turned
towards her: &lsquo;Weep not, golden one; fear nought.&rsquo; When
they arrived at the lake, the sheep immediately spread round
it, and the prince placed the falcon on the stump, and the
hounds and bagpipes under it, then tucked up his hose and
sleeves, waded into the water, and shouted: &lsquo;Dragon!
dragon! Come out to single combat with me; let us
measure ourselves once more, unless you&rsquo;re a woman!&rsquo;
The dragon replied: &lsquo;I will, prince; now, now!&rsquo; Erelong,
there was the dragon! it was huge, it was terrible, it was
disgusting! When it came out, they seized each other by
the middle, and wrestled a summer&rsquo;s day till afternoon.
But when the afternoon heat came on, the dragon said:
&lsquo;Let me go, prince, that I may moisten my parched head in
the lake, and toss you to the skies.&rsquo; The prince replied:
&lsquo;Come, dragon, don&rsquo;t talk nonsense; if I had the emperor&rsquo;s
daughter to kiss me on the forehead, I would toss you much
higher.&rsquo; When he said this, the emperor&rsquo;s daughter ran up
and kissed him on the face, on the eye, and on the forehead.
Then he swung the dragon, and tossed it high into the air,
and when it fell to the ground it burst into pieces. But as
it burst into pieces, out of it sprang a wild boar, and started
to run away. But the prince shouted to his shepherd dogs:
&lsquo;Hold it! don&rsquo;t let it go!&rsquo; and the dogs sprang up and
after it, caught it, and soon tore it to pieces. But out of
the boar flew a pigeon, and the prince loosed the falcon,
and the falcon caught the pigeon and brought it into the
prince&rsquo;s hands. The prince said to it: &lsquo;Tell me now,
where are my brothers?&rsquo; The pigeon replied: &lsquo;I will;
only do me no harm. Immediately behind your father&rsquo;s
town is a water-mill, and in the water-mill are three wands
that have sprouted up. Cut these three wands up from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
below, and strike with them upon their root; an iron door
will immediately open into a large vault. In that vault are
many people, old and young, rich and poor, small and
great, wives and maidens, so that you could settle a populous
empire; there, too, are your brothers.&rsquo; When the
pigeon had told him all this, the prince immediately wrung
its neck.</p>

<p>The emperor had gone out in person, and posted himself
on the hill from which the grooms had viewed the shepherd,
and he, too, was a spectator of all that had taken
place. After the shepherd had thus obtained the dragon&rsquo;s
head, twilight began to approach. He washed himself
nicely, took the falcon on his shoulder, the hounds behind
him, and the bagpipes under his arm, played as he went,
drove the sheep, and proceeded to the emperor&rsquo;s palace,
with the damsel at his side still in terror. When they came
to the town, all the town assembled as to see a wonder.
The emperor, who had seen all his heroism from the hill,
called him into his presence, and gave him his daughter,
went immediately to church, had them married, and held a
wedding festival for a week. After this the prince told him
who and whence he was, and the emperor and the whole
town rejoiced still more. Then, as the prince was urgent
to go to his own home, the emperor gave him a large
escort, and equipped him for the journey. When they were
in the neighbourhood of the water-mill, the prince halted his
attendants, went inside, cut up the three wands, and struck
the root with them, and the iron door opened at once. In
the vault was a vast multitude of people. The prince
ordered them to come out one by one, and go whither each
would, and stood himself at the door. They came out thus
one after another, and lo! there were his brothers also,
whom he embraced and kissed. When the whole multitude
had come out, they thanked him for releasing and delivering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
them, and went each to his own home. But he went to his
father&rsquo;s house with his brothers and bride, and there lived
and reigned to the end of his days.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap44" id="chap44"></a>XLIV.&mdash;FATE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were two brothers living together in a house, one
of whom did all the work, while the other did nothing but
idle, and eat and drink what was ready at hand. And God
gave them prosperity in everything&mdash;in cattle, in horses, in
sheep, in swine, in bees, and in everything else. The one
that worked one day began to think to himself: &lsquo;Why
should I work for that lazybones as well? It is better that
we should separate, and that I should work for myself, and
he do as he likes.&rsquo; So one day he said to his brother:
&lsquo;Brother, it isn&rsquo;t right. I do all the work, and you don&rsquo;t
help in anything, but merely eat and drink what&rsquo;s ready. I
have made up my mind that we separate.&rsquo; The other began
to dissuade him: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, brother; it is good for us to be
tenants in common; you have everything in your hands,
both your own and mine, and I am content whatever you
do.&rsquo; But the first abode by his determination, so the
second gave way, and said to him: &lsquo;If it is so, take your
own course; make the division yourself, as you know how.&rsquo;
Then he divided everything in order, and took everything
that was his before him. The do-nothing engaged a herdsman
for his cattle, a horsekeeper for his horses, a shepherd
for his sheep, a goatherd for his goats, a swineherd for
his swine, a beeman for his bees, and said to them: &lsquo;I
leave all my property in your hands and God&rsquo;s,&rsquo; and began
to live at home as before. The first took pains about his
property himself as before, watched and overlooked, but
saw no prosperity, but all loss. From day to day everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
went worse, till he became so poverty-stricken, that he
hadn&rsquo;t shoes to his feet, but went barefoot. Then said he
to himself: &lsquo;I will go to my brother, and see how it is with
him.&rsquo; He did so, and as he went came to a flock of sheep
in a meadow, and with the sheep there was no shepherd,
but a very beautiful damsel was sitting there spinning golden
thread. He addressed her: &lsquo;God help you!&rsquo; and inquired
whose the sheep were. She replied: &lsquo;The sheep belong to
the person to whom I belong.&rsquo; He asked her further: &lsquo;To
whom do you belong?&rsquo; She answered: &lsquo;I am your
brother&rsquo;s luck.&rsquo; He was put out, and said to her: &lsquo;And
where is my luck?&rsquo; The damsel answered him: &lsquo;Your luck
is far from you.&rsquo; &lsquo;But can I find it?&rsquo; inquired he, and
she replied: &lsquo;You can; go, seek for it.&rsquo; When he heard
this, and saw that his brother&rsquo;s sheep were good&mdash;so good,
that they could not be better, he didn&rsquo;t care about going
further to see other cattle, but went off straight to his
brother. When his brother saw him, he had compassion on
him, and began to weep: &lsquo;Where have you been so long a
time?&rsquo; Then, seeing him barehead and barefoot, he gave
him at once a pair of boots and some money. Afterwards,
when they had enjoyed each other&rsquo;s company for some
days, the visitor rose up to go to his own house. When he
got home, he took a wallet on his back, some bread in it,
and a staff in his hand, and went into the world to look for
his luck. As he travelled, he came to a large wood, and
as he went through it, he saw a gray-haired old maid asleep
under a bush, and reached out his staff to give her a push.
She barely raised herself up, and, hardly opening her eyes
for the rheum, addressed him: &lsquo;Thank God that I fell asleep,
for, if I had been awake, you wouldn&rsquo;t have obtained even
that pair of boots.&rsquo; Then he said to her: &lsquo;Who are you,
that I shouldn&rsquo;t even have obtained this pair of boots?&rsquo; She
replied: &lsquo;I am your luck.&rsquo; When he heard this, he began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
to beat his breast: &lsquo;If you are my luck, God slay you!
Who gave you to me?&rsquo; She quickly rejoined: &lsquo;Fate gave
me to you.&rsquo; He then inquired: &lsquo;And where is this Fate?&rsquo;
She answered: &lsquo;Go and look for him.&rsquo; And that instant
she disappeared. Then the man went on to look for Fate.
As he journeyed, he came to a village, and saw in the
village a large farmhouse, and in it a large fire, and said to
himself: &lsquo;Here there is surely some merry-making or
festival,&rsquo; and went in. When he went in, on the fire was a
large caldron, in which supper was cooking, and in front of
the fire sat the master of the house. The traveller, on going
into the house, addressed the master: &lsquo;Good-evening!&rsquo;
The master replied: &lsquo;God give you prosperity!&rsquo; and bade
him sit down with him, and then began to ask him whence
he came, and whither he was going. He related to him
everything: how he had been a master, how he had become
impoverished, and how he was now going to Fate to ask
him why he was so poor. Then he inquired of the master
of the house why he was preparing so large a quantity of
food, and the master said to him: &lsquo;Well, my brother, I
am master here, and have enough of everything, but I
cannot anyhow satisfy my people; it is quite as if a dragon
were in their stomachs. You&rsquo;ll see, when we begin to sup,
what they will do.&rsquo; When they sat down to sup, everybody
snatched and grabbed from everybody else, and that large
caldron of food was empty in no time. After supper, a
maidservant came in, put all the bones in a heap, and threw
them behind the stove; and he began to wonder why the
young woman threw the bones behind the stove, till all at
once out came two old poverty-stricken spectres, as dry as
ghosts, and began to suck the bones. Then he asked the
master of the house: &lsquo;What&rsquo;s this, brother, behind the
stove?&rsquo; He replied: &lsquo;Those, brother, are my father and
mother; just as if they were fettered to this world, they will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
not quit it.&rsquo; The next day, at his departure, the master of
the house said to him: &lsquo;Brother, remember me, too, if anywhere
you find Fate, and ask him what manner of misfortune
it is that I cannot satisfy my people, and why my father and
mother do not die.&rsquo; He promised to ask him the question,
took leave of him, and went on to look for Fate. As on he
went, he came, after a long time, to another village, and
begged at a certain house that they would take him in for a
night&rsquo;s lodging. They did so, and asked him whither he
was going; and he told them all in order, what it was, and
how it was. Then they began to say to him: &lsquo;In God&rsquo;s
name, brother, when you get there, ask him with regard to
us too, why our cattle are not productive, but the contrary.&rsquo;
He promised them to ask Fate the question, and the next
day went on. As he went, he came to a stream of water,
and began to shout: &lsquo;Water! water! carry me across.&rsquo;
The water asked him: &lsquo;Whither are you going?&rsquo; He told
it whither he was going. Then the water carried him
across, and said to him: &lsquo;I pray you, brother, ask Fate
why I have no offspring.&rsquo; He promised the stream to ask the
question, and then went on. He went on for a long time, and
at last came to a wood, where he found a hermit, whom he
asked whether he could tell him anything about Fate. The
hermit answered: &lsquo;Go over the hill yonder, and you will come
right in front of his abode; but when you come into Fate&rsquo;s
presence, do not say a word, but do exactly what he does,
until he questions you himself.&rsquo; The man thanked the
hermit, and went over the hill. When he came to Fate&rsquo;s
abode, there was something for him to see. It was just as
if it were an emperor&rsquo;s palace; there were men-servants and
maid-servants there; everything was in good order, and Fate
himself was sitting at a golden dinner-table at supper.
When the man saw this, he, too, sat down to table, and
began to sup. After supper, Fate lay down to sleep, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
lay down too. About midnight a terrible noise arose, and
out of the noise a voice was heard: &lsquo;Fate! Fate! so many
souls have been born to-day; assign them what you will.&rsquo;
Then Fate arose, and opened a chest with money in it, and
began to throw nothing but ducats behind him, saying:
&lsquo;As to me to-day, so to them for life!&rsquo; When on the
morrow day dawned, that large palace was no more, but instead
of it a moderate-sized house; but in it again there
was enough of everything.</p>

<p>At the approach of evening Fate sat down to supper; and
he, too, sat down with him, but neither spoke a single word.
After supper they lay down to sleep. About midnight a
terrible noise began, and out of the noise was heard a voice:
&lsquo;Fate! Fate! so many souls have been born to-day;
assign them what you will.&rsquo; Then Fate arose, and opened
the money-chest; but there were not ducats in it, but silver
coins, with an occasional ducat. Fate began to scatter the
coins behind him, saying: &lsquo;As to me to-day, so to them for
life.&rsquo; When, on the morrow, day dawned, that house was
no more, but instead of it there stood a smaller one. Thus
did Fate every night, and his house became smaller every
morning, till, finally, nothing remained of it but a little
cottage. Fate took a mattock, and began to dig; the man,
too, took a mattock and began to dig, and thus they dug all
day. When it was eventide, Fate took a piece of bread,
broke off half of it, and gave it to him. Thus they supped,
and, after supper, lay down to sleep. About midnight,
again, a terrible noise began, and out of the noise was heard
a voice: &lsquo;Fate! Fate! so many souls have been born to-day;
assign them what you will.&rsquo; Then Fate arose, opened
the chest, and began to scatter behind him nothing but bits
of rag, and here and there a day-labourer&rsquo;s wage-penny,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
shouting: &lsquo;As to me to-day, so to them for life.&rsquo; When he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
arose on the morrow, the cottage was transformed into a
large palace, like that which had been there the first day.
Then Fate asked him: &lsquo;Why have you come?&rsquo; He detailed
to him all his distress, and said that he had come to ask him
why he gave him evil luck. Fate then said to him: &lsquo;You
saw how the first night I scattered ducats, and what took
place afterwards. As it was to me the night when anyone
was born, so will it be to him for life. You were born on
an unlucky night, you will be poor for life; but your brother
was born on a lucky night, and he will be lucky for life.
But, as you have been so resolute, and have taken so much
trouble, I will tell you how you may help yourself. Your
brother has a daughter, Militza, who is lucky, just as her
father is; adopt her, and, whatever you acquire, say that it
is all hers.&rsquo; Then he thanked Fate, and said to him again:
&lsquo;In such a village there is a wealthy peasant, who has
enough of everything; but he is unlucky in this, that his
people can never be satisfied: they eat up a caldron full of
food at a single meal, and even that is too little for them.
And this peasant&rsquo;s father and mother are, as it were, fettered
to this world; they are old and discoloured, and dried up
like ghosts, but cannot die. He begged me, Fate, when I
lodged with him for the night, to ask you why that was the
case.&rsquo; Then Fate replied: &lsquo;All that is because he does not
honour his father and mother, throwing their food behind
the stove; but, if he puts them in the best place at table,
and if he gives them the first cup of brandy, and the first
cup of wine, his servants would not eat half so much, and
his parents&rsquo; souls would be set at liberty.&rsquo; After this he
again questioned Fate: &lsquo;In such a village, when I spent the
night in a house, the householder complained to me that his
cattle were not productive, but the contrary, and he begged
me to ask you why this was the case.&rsquo; Fate replied: &lsquo;That
is because on the festival of his name-day he slaughters the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>237]</a></span>
worst animals; but if he slaughtered the best he has, his
cattle would all become productive.&rsquo; Then he asked him
the question about the stream of water: &lsquo;Why should it be
that that stream of water has no offspring?&rsquo; Fate replied:
&lsquo;Because it has never drowned a human being; but don&rsquo;t
have any nonsense; don&rsquo;t tell it till it carries you across, for
if you tell it, it will immediately drown you.&rsquo; Then he
thanked Fate, and went home. When he came to the
water, the water asked him: &lsquo;What is the news from Fate?&rsquo;
He replied: &lsquo;Carry me over, and then I will tell you.&rsquo;
When the water had carried him over, he ran on a little,
and, when he had got a little way off, turned and shouted
to the water: &lsquo;Water! Water! you have never drowned
a human being, therefore you have no offspring.&rsquo; When
the water heard that, it overflowed its banks, and after him;
but he ran, and barely escaped. When he came to the man
whose cattle were unproductive, he was impatiently waiting
for him. &lsquo;What news, brother, in God&rsquo;s name? Have you
asked Fate the question?&rsquo; He replied: &lsquo;I have; and Fate
says when you celebrate the festival of your name-day, you
slaughter the worst animals; but if you slaughter the best
you have, all your cattle will be productive.&rsquo; When he
heard this, he said to him: &lsquo;Stay, brother, with us; it isn&rsquo;t
three days to my name-day, and, if it is really true, I
will give you an apple.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> He stayed till the name-day.
When the name-day arrived, the householder slaughtered
his best ox, and from that time forth his cattle became productive.
After this, the householder presented him with
five head of cattle. He thanked him, and proceeded on his
way. When he came to the village of the householder who
had the insatiable servants, the householder was impatiently
expecting him. &lsquo;How is it, brother, in God&rsquo;s name?
What says Fate?&rsquo; He replied: &lsquo;Fate says you do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span>
honour your father and mother, but throw their food behind
the stove for them to eat; if you put them in the best place
at table, and give them the first cup of brandy, and the first
cup of wine, your people will not eat half as much, and
your father and mother will be content.&rsquo; When the householder
heard this, he told his wife, and she immediately
washed and combed her father and mother in law, and put
nice shoes on their feet; and, when evening came, the
householder put them in the best place at table, and gave
them the first cup of brandy and the first cup of wine.
From that time forth the household could not eat half what
they did before, and on the morrow both the father and the
mother departed this life. Then the householder gave him
two oxen; he thanked him, and went home. When he
came to his place of abode, his acquaintances began to congratulate
him, and ask him: &lsquo;Whose are these cattle?&rsquo; He
replied to everybody: &lsquo;Brother, they are my niece Militza&rsquo;s.&rsquo;
When he got home he immediately went off to his brother,
and began to beg and pray him: &lsquo;Give me, brother, your
daughter Militza to be my daughter. You see that I have
no one.&rsquo; His brother replied: &lsquo;It is good, brother;
Militza is yours.&rsquo; He took Militza, and conducted her
home, and afterwards acquired much, but said, with regard
to everything, that it was Militza&rsquo;s. Once he went out into
the field to go round some rye; the rye was beautiful; it
could not be better. Thereupon a traveller happened to
come up, and asked him: &lsquo;Whose is this rye?&rsquo; He forgot
himself, and said: &lsquo;Mine.&rsquo; The moment he said that, the
rye caught fire and began to burn. When he saw this, he
ran after the man: &lsquo;Stop, brother! it is not mine; it belongs
to Militza, my niece.&rsquo; Then the fire in the rye went out,
and he remained lucky with Militza.</p>

<h3><a name="part03c" id="part03c"></a><i>SERBIAN STORIES FROM BOSNIA.</i></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Bosnian stories are not written in the Cyrillic,
but in the Latin character. This indicates that
the Christian inhabitants of Bosnia belong to the Latin
rather than to the Greek Church. The Serbians of the
Kingdom of Serbia would, no doubt, gladly absorb Bosnia,
but it is very doubtful whether the Bosnians would be
equally glad to be absorbed by them. In Bosnia the
landed proprietors are extensively Mahometans, and neither
they nor the Latin Christians would be very willing to place
themselves under the domination of the Orthodox Greek
Church, without much stronger guarantees than the Serbians
of the kingdom, as at present constituted, are likely to be
able or willing to give them.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap45" id="chap45"></a>XLV.&mdash;THE BIRDCATCHER.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Near</span> Constantinople there lived a man who knew no other
occupation but that of catching birds; his neighbours called
him the birdcatcher. Some he used to sell, others served
him for food, and thus he maintained himself. One day
he caught a crow, and wanted to let it go, but then he had
nothing to take home. &lsquo;If I can&rsquo;t catch anything to-day,
I&rsquo;ll take my children the crow, that they may amuse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
themselves; and they have no other birds at hand.&rsquo; So he
intended, and so he did. His wife, on seeing the crow,
said: &lsquo;What mischief have you brought me? Wring the
worthless thing&rsquo;s neck!&rsquo; The crow, on hearing that sentence,
besought the birdcatcher to let her go, and promised to be
always at his service. &lsquo;I will bring birds to you; through
me you will become prosperous.&rsquo; &lsquo;Even if you&rsquo;re lying,
it&rsquo;s no great loss,&rsquo; said the birdcatcher to himself, and set
the crow at liberty.</p>

<p>On the morrow the birdcatcher went out birdcatching as
usual, and the crow kept her word; she brought him two
nightingales; he caught them both, and took them home.
The nightingales were not long with the birdcatcher, for
the grand vizier heard of them, sent for the birdcatcher,
took the two nightingales from him, and placed them in the
new mosque. The nightingales were able to sing sweetly
and agreeably; the people collected in front of the mosque
and listened to their beautiful singing; and the wonder
came to the ears of the emperor. The emperor summoned
the grand vizier, took the birds from him, and inquired
whence he had got them. When the emperor had thought
the matter over, he sent his cavasses, and they summoned
the birdcatcher. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no joke to go before the emperor!
I know why he summons me; no half torture will be mine.
I am guilty of nothing, I owe nothing; but the emperor&rsquo;s
will, that&rsquo;s my crime!&rsquo; said the birdcatcher, and went into
the emperor&rsquo;s presence all pale with fear. &lsquo;Birdcatcher,
sirrah! are you the catcher of those nightingales which were
at the new mosque?&rsquo; &lsquo;Padishah! both father and mother!
where your slipper is, there is my face!&mdash;I am.&rsquo; &lsquo;Sirrah!&rsquo;
again said the emperor, &lsquo;I wish you to find their mother;
doubtless your reward will be forthcoming. But do you
hear? You may be quite sure of it; if you don&rsquo;t, there will
be no head on your shoulders. I&rsquo;m not joking.&rsquo; Now the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
poor fellow went out of the emperor&rsquo;s presence, and how he
got home he didn&rsquo;t know; a good two hours afterwards he
came to himself and began to lament. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a fool! I
thought my trade led no-whither, and not to misfortune for
me; but now see! To find the mother of the birds&mdash;none
but a fool could imagine it&mdash;and to catch her!&rsquo; To this
lamentation there was neither limit nor end. It was getting
dark, and his wife summoned him to supper; just then the
crow was at the window: &lsquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rsquo; the crow asked.
&lsquo;What are these lamentations? What&rsquo;s the distress?&rsquo; &lsquo;Let
me alone; don&rsquo;t add to my torture; I&rsquo;m done for owing to
you!&rsquo; said the birdcatcher, and told her all, what it was and
how it was. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s easy,&rsquo; answered she; &lsquo;go to the
emperor to-morrow, and ask for a thousand loads of wheat;
then pile up the corn in one heap, and I will inform the
birds that the emperor gives them a feast; they will all
assemble; <em>their</em> mother, too, will doubtless come; the one
with regard to which I give you a sign is she; bring a cage,
put the two nightingales in it; the mother, seeing her two
young birds, will fly up; let your snare be ready, and then
we shall find and catch her.&rsquo; As the crow instructed him,
so he did. The emperor gave him the corn; he feasted
the birds, caught the mother of the nightingales, and took
her to the emperor. He received a handsome reward, but
he would gladly have gone without such reward when he
remembered how many tears he had shed. The crow, too,
received a reward, for she persuaded the birdcatcher to give
his wife a good beating, which he did, to the satisfaction
of the crow, in her presence.</p>

<p>Time after time, behold some of the emperor&rsquo;s cavasses!
&lsquo;Come, the emperor summons you!&rsquo; sounded from the
door. &lsquo;A new misfortune! a new sorrow!&rsquo; thought the
birdcatcher in his heart, and went before the emperor.
&lsquo;Do you hear, sirrah? Just now I paid you a good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
recompense, now a greater one awaits you. I wish you to seek
the mistress of those birds, otherwise, valah! bilah! your
head will be in danger! Do you understand me?&rsquo; At
these words of the emperor the birdcatcher either could not
or dared not utter a word; he shrugged his shoulders and
went out of his presence. As he went home he talked to
himself weeping: &lsquo;I see that he is determined to destroy
me, and some devil has put it into his head to torture me
first.&rsquo; On arriving at home he found his crow at the
window: &lsquo;Has some misfortune again occurred to you?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ask,&rsquo; replied the birdcatcher; &lsquo;one still blacker
and more miserable!&rsquo; and told her all in detail, what it was
and how it was. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble your head much about
that,&rsquo; said the crow. &lsquo;Be quick; ask the emperor for a
boat full of all manner of wares. Then we will push off
on the deep sea; when people hear that the emperor&rsquo;s agent
is bringing wares, the people will assemble, and that lady is
sure to come; the one on which I perch is she; up anchor
and off with the boat!&rsquo; This the birdcatcher remembered
well. What he asked of the emperor, that he gave him,
and he pushed the boat over the sea; his bringing wares
for sale went from mouth to mouth; people came and
purchased the wares. At last came the mistress of the
birds also, and began to examine the wares; the crow
perched on her shoulder; the anchor was raised, and in a
short time the birdcatcher brought the boat to under the
emperor&rsquo;s quay. When the birdcatcher brought her before
the emperor, the emperor was astounded. He didn&rsquo;t know
which to admire most, the birdcatcher&rsquo;s cleverness or her
beauty. Her beauty overpowered the emperor&rsquo;s mind; he
rewarded the birdcatcher handsomely, and placed the
sultana in his house. &lsquo;You are the dearest to me of all,&rsquo;
said the emperor several times to her; &lsquo;if I were to banish
all the sultanas, you should never go out of my seraglio.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>243]</a></span>
The birdcatcher was again in evil case. The new sultana
was in a perpetual state of irritation, for it was poor luck to
be obliged to be affectionate to an elderly longbeard. The
emperor comforted her, and asked her what failed her, when
she had everything in abundance with him. A woman&rsquo;s
revenge is worse than a cat&rsquo;s. Not daring to tell the
emperor the truth, she wanted to revenge herself on the
poor birdcatcher. &lsquo;Dear Padishah, I had a valuable ring
on my hand when that birdcatcher deluded me into the
boat, and pushed it from the shore. I began to wring my
hands in distress, the ring broke, and one half fell into the
sea, just where it was my hap to be. But, dear sultan, if I
am a little dear to you, send that birdcatcher, let him seek
that half for me, that I may unite it to this one.&rsquo; &lsquo;All shall
be done,&rsquo; said the emperor; and the cavasses soon brought
the birdcatcher. &lsquo;My son,&rsquo; said the emperor, &lsquo;if you do not
intend to lose my love and favour, hearken to me once
more. At the place where you captured that lady, she
broke a ring; it fell into the sea. I know that you can do
so&mdash;find her that half; your reward will not fail; otherwise,
you know....&rsquo; When the poor fellow got home, a fit of
laughter seized him from distress. &lsquo;I knew that the devil
was teaching him how to torment and torture me before he
put me to death. If hell were to open, all the devils
wouldn&rsquo;t find it!&rsquo; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, friend?&rsquo; said the
crow. &lsquo;Till now you were weeping and complaining, and
now in a rage you are laughing.&rsquo; He told her all&mdash;what it
was, and how it was. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t fret yourself,&rsquo; continued the
crow. &lsquo;Have you given your wife a good thrashing? I
wish you to give her a good hiding again, when we go down
to the sea. And now come, ask the emperor for a thousand
barrels of oil.&rsquo; The emperor had stores of oil and felt; he
gave him as much as he required. Everybody thought that
he was going to trade with the oil. When he arrived at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244]</a></span>
place where he captured the young lady, the crow gave the
word of command, and they poured out all the oil into the
sea. The sea became violently agitated, the crow darted in,
and found the missing fragment of the ring. The birdcatcher
took the boat back thence under the emperor&rsquo;s
palace, and delivered the ring to the emperor, he passed it
on to the lady, and she fitted it to the other half. Both she
and the emperor were astonished at the birdcatcher&rsquo;s
cleverness, commended him, and sent him home with a
present.</p>

<p>The emperor wished by every means to induce the young
lady to marry him, and to have a formal wedding. She for
a long time declined, but at last said: &lsquo;If it is your will, I
consent, but only on condition that before our wedding you
destroy that birdcatcher.&rsquo; The emperor now found himself
between two fires. It was agony to destroy his benefactor,
it was worse agony not to be able to withstand his heart,
and to give up the love of the young lady. Love is eternal,
and is often stronger even than truth. He summoned the
birdcatcher, commended him for having so often fulfilled
his will, and told him that he deserved to sit in the grand
vizier&rsquo;s seat.... &lsquo;But there is nothing else for it, but you
must go home, take leave of your wife, children, and friends,
of whom I will undertake the care; in the afternoon
come; you must of necessity jump into the fire.&rsquo; He went
home, and the crow came to meet him. He told her all
that was to be done with him in the afternoon, and said to
her: &lsquo;If you do not help me as usual now, I am done for,
not through my fault, nor through the emperor&rsquo;s, but owing
to you.&rsquo; The crow informed him what to do, but before he
went, he was to give his wife a thoroughly good beating.
His wife departed this life from so many blows. A fire was
flaming before the great mosque, the Turks came out of the
mosque, the emperor came, the people swarmed round the
fire. The birdcatcher came cheerfully before the emperor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>245]</a></span>
Everyone deemed him a malefactor. &lsquo;Fortunate Padishah,
it is your pleasure to burn me to death. I am happy to be
able to be a sacrifice for you. It has occurred to my mind,
I am anxious to have a ride on a good horse: permit me so
to do before I jump into the fire.&rsquo; The emperor smiled,
and ordered his best horse to be brought for him. He
mounted, and made the horse gallop well; when the horse
sweated, he dismounted, anointed himself with the horse&rsquo;s
foam, remounted, darted up to the fire, then dismounted,
and darted into the fire. The people looked on; five times,
six times did he cross the flames, sprang out of the fire, and
stood before the emperor as a youth of twenty years of age,
sound, young, goodly, and handsome. The people cried:
&lsquo;Mercy, emperor! He has fulfilled his penalty.&rsquo; And the
emperor graciously pardoned him. The emperor now
longed to become young and handsome also. He made
the birdcatcher grand vizier, merely that he might tell him
the secret. He said to him: &lsquo;My lord, it is easy. Take a
good horse, gallop about an hour as I did, dismount when
the horse sweats, anoint yourself with his perspiration, jump
into the fire, and you will come out such as I am.&rsquo; Friday
dawned; the emperor&rsquo;s best horse was saddled for him;
everybody thought that he was going to the mosque. A fire
was burning furiously in front of the mosque. The people
said: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s somebody going to jump in again,&rsquo; and they
were under no delusion. The emperor darted up to the
fire all alone, the people looked on to see what was going to
happen. The emperor dismounted with great speed, and
sprang into the fire.... The people crowded to rescue the
emperor&mdash;&rsquo;twas all in vain. The emperor was burned to
death. &lsquo;He was crazy!&rsquo; shouted the chief men and soldiers.
They conducted the birdcatcher into the mosque, and girt
him with the emperor&rsquo;s sword. Then the birdcatcher
became emperor, the damsel he selected sultana, and the
crow the chief lady at court.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap46" id="chap46"></a>XLVI.&mdash;THE TWO BROTHERS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a man who had a wife but no sons, a female
hound but no puppies, and a mare but no foal. &lsquo;What in
the world shall I do?&rsquo; said he to himself. &lsquo;Come, let me
go away from home to seek my fortune in the world, as I
haven&rsquo;t any at home.&rsquo; As he thought, so he did, and went
out by himself into the white world as a bee from flower to
flower. One day, when it was about dinner-time, he came
to a spring, took down his knapsack, took out his provisions
for the journey, and began to eat his dinner. Just then a
traveller appeared in front of him, and sat down beside the
spring to rest; he invited him to sit down by him that they
might eat together. When they had inquired after each
other&rsquo;s health and shaken hands, then the second comer
asked the first on what business he was travelling about the
world. He said to him: &lsquo;I have no luck at home, therefore
I am going from home; my wife has no children, my
hound has no puppies, and my mare has never had a foal;
I am going about the white world as a bee from flower to
flower.&rsquo; When they had had a good dinner, and got up to
travel further, then the one who had arrived last thanked
the first for his dinner, and offered him an apple, saying:
&lsquo;Here is this apple for you&rsquo;&mdash;if I am not mistaken it was a
Frederic pippin&mdash;&lsquo;and return home at once; peel the apple
and give the peel to your hound and mare; cut the apple
in two, give half to your wife to eat, and eat the other half
yourself. What has hitherto been unproductive will henceforth
be productive. And as for the two pips which you
will find in the apple, plant them on the top of your house.&rsquo;
The man thanked him for the apple; they rose up and
parted, the one going onwards and the other back to his
house. He peeled the apple and did everything as the
other had instructed him. As time went on his wife became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>247]</a></span>
the mother of two sons, his hound of two puppies, and his
mare of two foals, and, moreover, out of the house grew two
apple-trees. While the two brothers were growing up, the
young horses grew up, and the hounds became fit for hunting.
After a short time the father and mother died, and the two
sons, being now left alone like a tree cut down on a hill,
agreed to go out into the world to seek their fortune. Even
so they did: each brother took a horse and a hound, they
cut down the two apple-trees, and made themselves a spear
apiece, and went out into the wide world. I can&rsquo;t tell you
for certain how many days they travelled together; this I
do know, that at the first parting of the road they separated.
Here they saw it written up: &lsquo;If you go by the upper road
you will not see the world for five years; if you go by the
lower road, you will not see the world for three years.&rsquo;
Here they parted, one going by the upper and the other by
the lower road. The one that went by the lower road, after
three years of travelling through another world, came to a
lake, beside which there was written on a post: &lsquo;If you go
in, you will repent it; if you don&rsquo;t go in, you will repent it.&rsquo;
&lsquo;If it is so,&rsquo; thought he to himself, &lsquo;let me take whatever
God gives,&rsquo; and swam across the lake. And lo! a wonder!
he, his horse, and his hound were all gilded with gold.
After this he speedily arrived at a very large and spacious
city. He went up to the emperor&rsquo;s palace and inquired for
an inn where he might pass the night. They told him, up
there, yon large tower, that was an inn. In front of this
tower he dismounted; servants came out and welcomed
him, and conducted him into the presence of their master
in the courtyard. But it was not an innkeeper, but the king
of the province himself. The king welcomed and entertained
him handsomely. The next day he began to prepare
to set forth on his journey. The evening before, the king&rsquo;s
only daughter, when she saw him go in front of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>248]</a></span>
apartments, had observed him well, and fixed her eyes upon him.
This she did because such a golden traveller had never
before arrived, and consequently she was unable to close
her eyes the whole night. Her heart thumped, as it were;
and it was fortunate that the summer night was brief, for if
it had been a winter one, she could hardly have waited for
the dawn. It all seemed to her and whirled in her brain as
if the king was calling her to receive a ring and an apple;
the poor thing would fly to the door, but it was shut and
there was nobody at hand. Although the night was a short
one, it seemed to her that three had passed one after another.
When she observed in the morning that the traveller was
getting ready to go, she flew to her father, implored him not
to let that traveller quit his court, but to detain him and to
give her to him in marriage. The king was good-natured,
and could easily be won over by entreaties; what his daughter
begged for, she also obtained. The traveller was detained
and offered marriage with the king&rsquo;s daughter. The traveller
did not hesitate long, kissed the king&rsquo;s hand, presented a
ring to the maiden, and she a handkerchief to him, and thus
they were betrothed. Methinks they did not wait for publication
of banns. Erelong they were wedded; the wedding
feast and festival were very prolonged, but came to an
end in due course. One morning after all this the bridegroom
was looking in somewhat melancholy fashion down on the
country through a window in the tower. His young wife
asked him what ailed him? He told her that he was
longing for a hunt, and she told him to take three servants
and go while the dew was still on the grass. Her husband
would not take a single servant, but mounting his gilded
horse and calling his gilded hound, went down into the
country to hunt. The hound soon found scent, and put up
a stag with gilded horns. The stag began to run straight
for a tower, the hound after him, and the hunter after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>249]</a></span>
hound, and he overtook the stag in the gate of the courtyard,
and was going to cut off its head. He had drawn his
sword, when a damsel cried through the window: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
kill my stag, but come upstairs: let us play at draughts for
a wager. If you win, take the stag; if I win, you shall give
me the hound.&rsquo; He was as ready for this as an old woman
for a scolding match, went up into the tower, and on to the
balcony, staked the hound against the stag, and they began
to play. The hunter was on the point of beating her, when
some damsels began to sing: &lsquo;A king, a king, I&rsquo;ve gained a
king!&rsquo; He looked round, she altered the position of the
draughtsmen, beat him and took the hound. Again they
began to play a second time, she staking the hound and he
his horse. She cheated him the second time also. The
third time they began to play, she wagered the horse, and
he himself. When the game was nearly over, and he was
already on the point of beating her, the damsels began to
sing this time too, just as they had done the first and second
times. He looked round, she cheated and beat him, took
a cord, bound him, and put him in a dungeon.</p>

<p>The brother, who went by the upper road, came to the
lake, forded it, and came out all golden&mdash;himself, his horse,
and his hound. He went for a night&rsquo;s lodging to the king&rsquo;s
tower; the servants came out and welcomed him. His
father-in-law asked him whether he was tired, and whether
he had had any success in hunting; but the king&rsquo;s daughter
paid special attention to him, frequently kissing and embracing
him. He couldn&rsquo;t wonder enough how it was
that everybody recognised him; finally, he felt satisfied that
it was his brother, who was very like him, that had been
there and got married. The king&rsquo;s daughter could not
wonder enough, and it was very distressing to her, that her
newly-married husband was so soon tired of her, for the
more affectionate she was to him, the more did he repulse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>250]</a></span>
her. When the morrow came, he got ready to go out to
look for his brother. The king, his daughter, and all the
courtiers, begged him to take a rest. &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said they to
him, &lsquo;you only returned yesterday from hunting, and do you
want to go again so soon?&rsquo; All was in vain; he refused to
take the thirty servants whom they offered him, but went
down into the country by himself. When he was in the
midst of the country, his hound put up a stag, and he after
them on his horse, and drove it up to a tower; he raised his
sword to kill the stag, but a damsel cried through a window:
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t meddle with my stag, but come upstairs that we may
have a game at draughts, then let the one that wins take off
the stakes, either you my hound, or I yours.&rsquo; When he
went into the basement, in it was a hound and a horse&mdash;the
hounds and horses recognised each other&mdash;and he felt sure
that his brother had fallen into prison there. They began
the game at draughts, and when the damsel saw that he
was going to beat her, some damsels began to sing behind
them: &lsquo;A king! a king! I&rsquo;ve gained a king!&rsquo; He took no
notice, but kept his eye on the draughtsmen; then the
damsel, like a she-devil, began to make eyes and wink at the
young man. He gave her a flip with his coat behind the
ears: &lsquo;Play now!&rsquo; and thus beat her. The second game
they both staked a horse. She couldn&rsquo;t cheat him; he took
both the hound and the horse from her. The third and
last time they played, he staking himself and she herself;
and after giving her a slap in her face for her winking and
making of eyes, he won the third game. He took possession
of her, brought his brother out of the dungeon, and they
went to the town.</p>

<p>Now the brother, who had been in prison, began to think
within himself: &lsquo;He was yesterday with my wife, and who
knows whether she does not prefer him to me?&rsquo; He drew
his sword to kill him, but the draught-player defended him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>251]</a></span>
He darted before his brother into the courtyard, and as he
stepped on to the passage from the tower, his wife threw her
arms round his neck and began to scold him affectionately
for having driven her from him overnight, and conversed so
coldly with her. Then he repented of having so foolishly
suspected his brother, who had, moreover, released him
from prison, and of having wanted to kill him; but his
brother was a considerate person and forgave him. They
kissed each other and were reconciled. He retained his
wife and her kingdom with her, and his brother took the
draught-player and her kingdom with her. And thus they
attained to greater fortune than they could ever have even
hoped for.</p>

<h3><a name="part03d" id="part03d"></a><i>SERBIAN STORIES FROM CARNIOLA.</i></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N these we come to a very singular mythological being,
<i>Kurent</i>, who has not, as yet, found a place in the
writings of Slavonic mythologists. With respect to Kurent,
Professor Krek writes as follows: &lsquo;The question as to the
nature of the Slovinish Kurent is very difficult, especially as
the tradition about him is, in my judgment, very corrupt.
So far as I know, no one has hitherto discussed it scientifically,
and what I am now writing to you is my own subjective
opinion, rapidly formed. The name itself does not
appear to be indigenous, but I think it is of Romance, perhaps
of medi&aelig;val Latin origin, though I am not yet able to
say what its signification is. In a mythological point of
view, there is to be observed in the stories about Kurent a
certain mixture of heathen-Slavonic and Christian elements;
but I think the basis is entirely indigenous. If I mistake
not, Kurent is essentially of Dionysiac signification, which
is indicated by the fact that the Slovinish stories connect
him closely with the vine-stock, and with wine in general,
just as is the case with the Greek Dionysos. It is noteworthy
that the Little Russians have the word &ldquo;Kurent&rdquo; in
the sense of a merry wedding tune (Zhelechovskij, i. 391),
and that the Slovinish tradition frequently puts Kurent in the
place of &ldquo;Pust,&rdquo; so that both represent the same mythological
idea. With regard to &ldquo;Pust,&rdquo; there is no doubt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>253]</a></span>
that, with his orgiastic system, he is just like the Greek
Dionysos, although his name is recent, and rests upon alien
conceptions; indeed, here the fact is of more decisive
import than the name. The name is not connected with
the old Slavonic &ldquo;pust,&rdquo; <i>desertus</i>, but with &ldquo;pust&rdquo; in the old
Slavonic &ldquo;mesopust,&rdquo; in Bohemian &ldquo;masopust,&rdquo; which are
identical with the Greek &#7936;&#960;&#8057;&#954;&#961;&#949;&#969;&#962;, in Latin &ldquo;carnisprivium.&rdquo;
Of what original names &ldquo;Kurent&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pust&rdquo; have occupied
the place, it will now never be possible to determine.
It is just in mythological matters, that all manner of old
traditions are unsatisfactory, as everybody knows who has
busied himself at all closely with this subject. Much that
is Christian has similarly become mingled with the original
pagan conceptions in the case of Kurent also, and it is not
easy to separate them from later accretions. I think that
the Slovintzes honoured Kurent with a special solemnity or
festival at the same time that the other Slavonians celebrated
the regeneration of winter, nature, and the birth of the solar
deity. This mythological phenomenon has its analogy in
the myths of other Ario-European nations, a matter so
generally known that there is no need of dilating upon it
now. What I wish to draw attention to is this: that the
Slovinish &ldquo;Kurent,&rdquo; as also his representative &ldquo;Pust&rdquo; is of
Dionysiac signification, and I don&rsquo;t know to what to compare
him more properly than to the Greek Dionysos.
Circumspection is especially necessary in mythological
matters, but I venture to affirm that my opinion will hold
its ground before severe criticism. I purpose treating at
greater length of this matter at a later time, but I do not
think I shall find it necessary to retract any portion of my
opinion.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Morfill informs me, moreover, that <i>Kurenta grati</i> is
given by Zhelikovskij in the sense &lsquo;to play the Kurent,&rsquo; <i>i.e.</i>,
the air so called.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the beginning there was nothing but God, and God
slept and dreamed. For ages and ages did this dream last.
But it was fated that he should wake up. Having roused
himself from sleep, he looked round about him, and every
glance transformed itself into a star. God was amazed, and
began to travel, to see what he had created with his eyes.
He travelled and travelled, but nowhere was there either end
or limit. As he travelled, he arrived at our earth also; but
he was already weary; sweat clung to his brow. On the
earth fell a drop of sweat: the drop became alive, and here
you have the first man. He is God&rsquo;s kin, but he was not
created for pleasure: he was produced from sweat; already
in the beginning it was fated for him to toil and sweat.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap48" id="chap48"></a>XLVIII.&mdash;GOD&rsquo;S COCK.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> earth was waste: nowhere was there aught but stone.
God was sorry for this, and sent his cock to make the earth
fruitful, as he knew how to do. The cock came down into
a cave in the rock, and fetched out an egg of wondrous
power and purpose. The egg chipped, and seven rivers
trickled out of it. The rivers irrigated the neighbourhood,
and soon all was green: there were all manner of flowers
and fruits; the land, without man&rsquo;s labour, produced wheat,
the trees not only apples and figs, but also the whitest and
sweetest bread. In this paradise men lived without care,
working, not from need, but for amusement and merriment.
Round the paradise were lofty mountains, so that there was
no violence to fear, nor devilish storm to dread. But
further: that men, otherwise their own masters, and free,
might not, from ignorance, suffer damage, God&rsquo;s cock
hovered high in the sky, and crowed to them every day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>255]</a></span>
when to get up, when to take their meals, and what to do,
and when to do it. The nation was happy, only God&rsquo;s cock
annoyed them by his continual crowing. Men began to
murmur, and pray God to deliver them from the restless
creature: &lsquo;Let us now settle for ourselves,&rsquo; said they, &lsquo;when
to eat, to work, and to rise.&rsquo; God hearkened to them; the
cock descended from the sky, but crowed to them just once
more: &lsquo;Woe is me! Beware of the lake!&rsquo; Men rejoiced,
and said that it was never better; no one any more interfered
with their freedom. After ancient custom, they ate,
worked, and rose, all in the best order, as the cock had
taught them. But, little by little, individuals began to think
that it was unsuitable for a free people to obey the cock&rsquo;s
crowing so slavishly, and began to live after their own
fashion, observing no manner of order. Through this arose
illnesses, and all kinds of distress; men looked again longingly
to the sky, but God&rsquo;s cock was gone for ever. They
wished, at any rate, to pay regard to his last words. But
they did not know how to fathom their meaning. The
cock had warned them to dread the lake, but why? for they
hadn&rsquo;t it in their valley; there flowed quietly, in their own
channel, the seven rivers which had burst out of the egg.
Men therefore conjectured that there was a dangerous lake
somewhere on the other side of the mountains, and sent a
man every day to the top of a hill to see whether he espied
aught. But there was danger from no quarter; the man
went in vain, and people calmed themselves again. Their
pride became greater and greater; the women made brooms
from the wheat-ears, and the men straw mattrasses. They
would not go any more to the tree to gather bread, but set
it on fire from below, that it might fall, and that they might
collect it without trouble. When they had eaten their fill,
they lay down by the rivers, conversed, and spoke all manner
of blasphemies. One cast his eyes on the water, wagged his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>256]</a></span>
head, and jabbered: &lsquo;Eh! brothers! A wondrous wonder!
I should like to know, at any rate, why the water is exactly
so much, neither more nor less.&rsquo; &lsquo;This, too,&rsquo; another
answered, &lsquo;was a craze of the cock&rsquo;s; it is disgraceful
enough for us to be listening to orders to beware of a lake,
which never was, and never will be. If my opinion is followed,
the watcher will go to-day for the last time. As
regards the rivers, I think it would be better if there were
more water.&rsquo; His neighbour at first agreed, but thought,
again, that there was water in abundance; if more, there
would be too much. A corpulent fellow put in energetically
that undoubtedly both were right; it would, therefore, be
the most sensible thing to break the egg up, and drive just
as much water as was wanted into each man&rsquo;s land, and
there was certainly no need of a watchman to look out for
the lake. Scarcely had these sentiments been delivered,
when an outcry arose in the valley; all rushed to the egg to
break it to pieces; all men deplored nothing but this, that
the disgraceful look-out could not be put a stop to before
the morrow. The people stood round the egg, the corpulent
man took up a stone, and banged it against the egg. It
split up with a clap of thunder, and so much water burst
out of it that almost the whole human race perished. The
paradise was filled with water, and became one great lake.
God&rsquo;s cock warned truly, but in vain, for the lawless people
did not understand him. The flood now reached the
highest mountains, just to the place where the watchman
was standing, who was the only survivor from the destruction
of mankind. Seeing the increasing waters, he began to flee.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap49" id="chap49"></a>XLIX.&mdash;KURENT THE PRESERVER.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Mankind</span> perished by the flood, and there was only one
who survived, and this was Kranyatz. Kranyatz fled higher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>257]</a></span>
and higher, till the water flooded the last mountain. The
poor wretch saw how the pines and shrubs were covered;
one vine, and one only, was still dry. To it he fled, and
quickly seized hold of it, not from necessity, but from
excessive terror; but how could it help him, being so
slender and weak? Kurent observed this, for the vine was
his stick, when he walked through the wide world. It was
agreeable to him that man should be thought to seek help
from him. It is true that Kurent was a great joker; but he
was also of a kindly nature, and was always glad to deliver
anyone from distress. Hearing Kranyatz lamenting, he
straightened the vine, his stick, and lengthened it more and
more, till it became higher than the clouds. After nine
years the flood ceased, and the earth became dry again.
But Kranyatz preserved himself by hanging on the vine,
and nourishing himself by its grapes and wine. When all
became dry, he got down, and thanked Kurent as his preserver.
But this didn&rsquo;t please Kurent. &lsquo;It was the vine
that rescued you,&rsquo; said he to Kranyatz; &lsquo;thank the vine, and
make a covenant with it, and bind yourself and your posterity,
under a curse, that you will always speak its praises
and love its wine more than any other food and drink.&rsquo;
Very willingly did the grateful Kranyatz make the engagement
for both himself and his posterity, and to this day
his descendants still keep faith, according to his promise,
loving wine above all things, and joyfully commemorating
Kurent, their ancient benefactor.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap50" id="chap50"></a>L.&mdash;KURENT AND MAN.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Kurent</span> and man contended which should rule the earth.
Neither Kurent would yield to man nor man to Kurent, for
he (man) was so gigantic&mdash;he wouldn&rsquo;t even have noticed it,
if nine of the people of the present day had danced up and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>258]</a></span>
down his nostrils. &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said Kurent, &lsquo;let us see which
is the stronger; whether it is I or you that is to rule the
earth. Yonder is a broad sea; the one that springs across
it best shall have both the earth and all that is on the other
side of the sea, and that is, in faith, a hundred times more
valuable than this wilderness.&rsquo; Man agreed. Kurent took
off his coat and jumped across the sea, so that just one foot
was wetted when he sprang on to dry land. Now he began
to jeer at the man; but the man held his tongue, didn&rsquo;t get
out of temper, neither did he take off his coat, but stepped
without effort and quite easily over the sea, as over a brook,
and came on to dry land without even wetting a foot. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
the stronger,&rsquo; said man to Kurent; &lsquo;see how my foot is
dry and yours is wet.&rsquo; &lsquo;The first time you have overcome
me,&rsquo; answered Kurent; &lsquo;yours are the plains, yours is the
sea, and what is beyond the sea; but that isn&rsquo;t all the earth,
there is also some beneath us and above us; come, then,
let us see a second time which is the stronger.&rsquo; Kurent
stood on a hollow rock, and stamped on it with his foot,
so that it burst with a noise like thunder, and split in pieces.
The rock broke up, and a cavern was seen where dragons
were brooding. Now the man also stamped, and the earth
quaked and broke up right to the bottom, just where pure
gold flowed like a broad river, and the dragons fell down
and were drowned in the river. &lsquo;This trial, too, is yours,&rsquo;
said Kurent; &lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t acknowledge you emperor till you
overpower me in a third fierce contest. Yonder is a very
lofty mountain. It rises above the clouds; it reaches to the
celestial table, where the cock sits and watches God&rsquo;s provisions.
Now, then, take you an arrow and shoot, and so
will I; the one which shoots highest is the stronger, and
his is the earth, and all that is beneath and above it.&rsquo;
Kurent shot, and his arrow wasn&rsquo;t back for eight days; then
the man shot, and his arrow flew for nine days, and when,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>259]</a></span>
on the tenth day, it fell, the celestial cock that guarded God&rsquo;s
provisions fell also, spitted upon it. &lsquo;You are emperor,&rsquo;
said cunning Kurent. &lsquo;I make obeisance to you, as befits
a subject.&rsquo; But the man was good-natured, and made a
covenant of adoptive brotherhood with Kurent, and went
off to enjoy his imperial dignity. Kurent, too, went off, but
he was annoyed that the man had put him to shame; where
he could not prevail by strength, he determined to succeed
by craft. &lsquo;You are a hero, man,&rsquo; he would say, &lsquo;I am
witness thereto; but beware of me, if you are a hero also
in simplicity; I go to bring you a gift, that I have devised
entirely by myself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He said and squeezed the vine, his stick, and pure red wine
burst out of it. &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a gift for you; now, then, where
are you?&rsquo; He found the man on the earth the other side
of the sea, where he was enjoying a bowl of sweet stirabout.
&lsquo;What are you doing, my lord?&rsquo; said Kurent. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
mixed a bowl of stirabout from white wheat and red fruit,
and, see, here I am eating it and drinking water.&rsquo; &lsquo;My
poor lord! you are emperor of the world and drinking
water! hand me a cup, that I may present you with better
drink, which I, your humble servant, have prepared for you
myself.&rsquo; The man was deceived, took the cup with red
wine, and drank some of it. &lsquo;Thank you, adopted brother;
you are very kind, but your drink is naught.&rsquo; Kurent was
disgusted, went off again, and thought and thought how to
cheat the man. Again he squeezed his stick, again red
wine burst forth from it, but Kurent did not allow it to
remain pure, but the rascal mixed hellebore with it, which
Vilas and prophetesses pluck by moonlight to nourish
themselves with. A second time he went in search of the
man, and found him at the bottom of the earth, where the
pure gold was flowing like a broad river. &lsquo;What are you
doing, my lord?&rsquo; asked Kurent. &lsquo;I am getting myself a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>260]</a></span>
golden shirt, and I am tired and very thirsty; but there&rsquo;s
no water here, and it&rsquo;s a long way to the world&mdash;seven years&rsquo;
journey.&rsquo; &lsquo;I am at your service,&rsquo; said Kurent; &lsquo;here&rsquo;s a
cup of wine for you; better never saw the red sun.&rsquo; The
man was deceived, took it, and drank it up. &lsquo;Thank you,
Kurent; you are good, and your drink is good, too.&rsquo; Kurent
was going to pour him out a fresh cupful, but the man
would not allow it, for his nature was still sober and
sensible. Kurent was disgusted, and went off to see whether
he could not devise something better. For the third time
he squeezed his stick; wine burst out more strongly, but
this time it did not remain pure nor without sin. The
rascal applied an arrow, opened a vein and let some black
blood flow into the wine. Again he went in search of the
man, and found him on the high mountain at God&rsquo;s table,
where he was feasting on roast meat, which had not been
roasted for him, but for God himself. &lsquo;What are you
doing, my lord?&rsquo; asked Kurent in amazement and joy, when
he saw that the man was sinning abominably. &lsquo;Here I
am, sitting and eating roast meat; but take yourself off, for
I am afraid of God, lest he should come up and smite me.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Never fear!&rsquo; was Kurent&rsquo;s advice; &lsquo;how do you like God&rsquo;s
roast meat?&rsquo; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s nice, but it&rsquo;s heavy. I can scarcely
swallow it.&rsquo; &lsquo;I am at your service,&rsquo; said Kurent; &lsquo;here is
wine for you, the like of which isn&rsquo;t on earth or in heaven,
but only with me.&rsquo; The third time the man was deceived,
but cruelly. &lsquo;Thank you, Kurent,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;you are good,
but your drink is better; draw me some more, as becomes
a faithful servant.&rsquo; Kurent did so, and the man&rsquo;s eye
became dim and his mind became dim, and he thought no
more of God, but remained at table. Suddenly God returned,
and seeing the man dozing and eating roast meat at
his table, became angry, and smote him down the mountain
with his mighty hand, where he lay, half dead, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>261]</a></span>
many years, all bruised and hurt. When he got well again
his strength had diminished; he could neither step across
the sea, nor go down to the bottom of the earth, nor uphill
to the celestial table. Thus Kurent ruled the world
and man, and mankind have been weak and dwarfed from
that time forth.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap51" id="chap51"></a>LI.&mdash;THE HUNDRED-LEAVED ROSE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> man contended with Kurent for the earth. Unable to
decide their dispute by agreement, they seized each other,
and struggled together up and down the earth for full seven
years; but neither could Kurent overcome the man, nor
the man Kurent. At that time they kicked the earth about
and broke it up, so that it became such as it now is: where
there was formerly nothing but wide plains, they dug out
ravines with their heels, and piled up mountains and hills.
When they were wearied with fighting, they both fell down
like dead corpses, and lay for a hundred and a hundred
years; and the mighty Dobrin hastened to the earth, bound
both the man and Kurent, and ruled the world. But the
two woke up, and, looking about them, observed Dobrin&rsquo;s
cords, and wondered who had thrown spider&rsquo;s webs over
them. Raising themselves, they broke their bonds as mere
spiders&rsquo; webs, seized Dobrin, bound him with golden fetters,
and handed him over to a fiery dragon, to plait the lady-dragon&rsquo;s
hair and wash her white hands. Then said Kurent
to the man: &lsquo;See, by quarrelling we got tired out, and fell
asleep, and a good-for-nothing came to us and ruled the
world. We have handed him over to the fiery dragon, but
if we contend as before, a stronger than Dobrin will come to
us, and will conquer both me and you, and we shall suffer
like silly Dobrin. But let us give up disputing; you are a
hero, and I think I am, too; the hills and abysses are our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>262]</a></span>
witnesses, when they crashed under our heels. Hear, therefore,
and follow my advice. I have a garden, and in my
garden is a mysterious plant, the hundred-leaved rose. By
the root it is attached to the bottom of the earth, imprisoning
a terrible creature&mdash;the living fire. In vain does the creature
endeavour to release and free itself from its bonds, the roots.
But woe to us, if you pull up the hundred-leaved rose out of
the earth! The creature &lsquo;living-fire&rsquo; would force its way
through, and the earth, and all that is in it, would become
nothing but a mighty desert where the water has dried up.
Such is the root of the hundred-leaved rose. But don&rsquo;t
seize hold of its top, either. It is in your power to pull it
off, it is neither too strong nor lofty, but it conceals within
it wondrous powers&mdash;lightning and thunder. They would
knock to pieces both you and the earth, and all that is
beneath it and above it; the hundred-leaved rose would
alone remain; but a hundred and a hundred of God&rsquo;s years
would elapse before a new earth grew up around it, and a
living race was again produced. Such is the garden of the
hundred-leaved rose. But it also possesses extraordinary
petals. I have often sat a day at a time under them, and
the petals would comfort me, and sing songs sweeter than
even the slender throat of a Vila singing ever uttered. But
from the petals there is no danger; pluck them, and
next morning they will sprout forth handsomer than ever.
But up to the present time I have not injured them, but
have noticed in the night, how they fell and raised themselves
again; and I easily understood how the stars and
the moon go round, for all came up in the sky just like the
petals of the hundred-leaved rose. Come, then; let us ask
the wondrous plant, and then make peace together. The
first petal is yours, the second mine, the third belongs to
neither of us, and so on till we pluck all the petals: let him
who pulls off the last petal be ruler on the earth, but not for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>263]</a></span>
ever, for that would be a disgrace to a hero, but for one of
God&rsquo;s hours, a hundred terrestrial years; and when the
hour passes, let that one rule again to whom that luck does
not fall the first time, whether it be I or you, so that we may
arrange to succeed each other in a friendly manner without
dispute and dangerous discord. But the beginning is difficult;
let us have no suspicion, either I as to you, or you as
to me, but let all be of goodwill, and without trickery; let
us ask the hundred-leaved rose, with whom there is no unrighteousness.&rsquo;
The man agreed to what Kurent said; one
hero trusted the other. They went off to the garden, and
asked the hundred-leaved rose. The man pulled a petal,
Kurent pulled one, and the third petal remained unowned.
&lsquo;I am yours,&rsquo; &lsquo;you are mine,&rsquo; &lsquo;each is his own;&rsquo; &lsquo;I am
yours,&rsquo; &lsquo;you are mine,&rsquo; &lsquo;each is his own;&rsquo; so said both
heroes, as they pulled the mysterious petals. But it was
not the will of the hundred-leaved rose that one autocrat
should rule the earth. There were still three petals, the
first belonging to the man, the second to Kurent, and the
third to neither, and this was the only one remaining on the
hundred-leaved rose. Kurent and the man saw that it was
not destined for either to rule or to humble himself; they
parted in grief, and roamed through the wide world, each
afraid of the other, so that they did not venture even to go
to sleep at night. An hour of God, a hundred terrestrial
years, elapsed, and then both heroes met again. For the
second time they consulted the hundred-leaved rose, and it
arranged it so, that Kurent was to humble himself, and the
man, who pulled off the last petal, was to rule. The hero
humbled himself to him, but the man did not know how to
rule, but allowed himself to be deluded, and lay down on a
plain to rest and sleep. Thus he lay for a whole hour of
God, a hundred terrestrial years, and the wild beasts came
up and made game of him: foxes littered in his ear, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>264]</a></span>
predaceous kites nested in his thick hair. The man was a
great simpleton, but also a mighty hero, as tall, as a plain,
the end of which you cannot see, is long, and as shaggy as
a wooded mountain. But the hour of God had elapsed,
and Kurent came to the sleeper, and woke him up in no
agreeable fashion. The man saw that he had slept through
his term of rule, and that it was his, according to the agreement,
to serve during an hour of God, a hundred terrestrial
years. Kurent began to rule, but he didn&rsquo;t go to sleep, but
made use of his rule, and exercised his power to the full.
He invited the man to dinner, and treated him in a courteous
and friendly manner, that he might soon forget his
servitude. Kurent kept this in view, and drew him a cup of
wine straight from his own vineyard. The simpleton was
tricked, and drank it up; but it tasted sour to him, so he
grumbled: &lsquo;Bad drink at a bad host&rsquo;s!&rsquo; Kurent did not
get angry at this, but drew him a second cup of old red
wine: &lsquo;Drink, and don&rsquo;t find fault with what is God&rsquo;s.&rsquo; The
second time the man was tricked and drank it up. It did not
taste sour to him, but he said: &lsquo;Wondrous drink at a wondrous
host&rsquo;s!&rsquo; Kurent drew him a third cup, of wonderful
wine, which the first plant, the first planted, yielded, of the
first autumn in the first created year. The third time the
man was tricked, but for ever. After drinking it up, he
threw his arms round Kurent&rsquo;s neck, and cried out: &lsquo;Oh,
good drink at a good host&rsquo;s! Treat me with this wine, and
rule both my body and soul, not only for one hour of God,
but from henceforth for evermore.&rsquo; Kurent was delighted,
and plied the man with sweet wine, and the man drank, and
cried without ceasing, that he had no need of freedom so
long as there was wine to be had with Kurent. Kurent
laughed at him, seeing how the man&rsquo;s powers had decayed
through wine, and that nobody could any more contend
with him for the sovereignty of the earth.</p>

<h3><a name="part03e" id="part03e"></a><i>CROATIAN STORIES.</i></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Croats are believed to take their name from their
former abode in the ancient Chrobatia, north of the
Carpathian Mountains, whose name retains the same root,
CRB(or P)T. Among them we meet with a wonderful hero,
&lsquo;Marko&rsquo; (<a href="#chap52">No. 52</a>), the account of whose <i>buzdovan</i>, or mace,
the southern representative of Thor&rsquo;s hammer, may be compared
with &lsquo;Little Rolling-pea&rsquo;s <i>bulava</i> (<a href="#chap22">No. 22</a>), and that
of Ivan Popyalof&rsquo; (Ralston, p. 66). Marko appears to have
been a very unprincipled hero, with very slight ideas of
honesty and fair-play. He is represented as gaining his
vast strength from a superhuman source&mdash;a Vila, of whom
more anon. In <a href="#chap53">No. 53</a>, we are carried into cloudland, and
meet with representatives of the Clashing Rocks&rsquo; (Symplegades),
through which the good ship <i>Argo</i> had to pass
before she could make her way into the Black Sea, and
which, till their reappearance in this story, seem to have
dropped altogether out of folklore. From this story, and
also from several incidents in <a href="#chap52">No. 52</a>, we perceive that the
Vilas of the South Slavonians are not denizens of the earth,
the waters, or the woods, but of the clouds, and thus a
journey has to be made into cloudland to find the daughter
of their king.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> <a href="#chap54">No. 54</a> will remind us of Aladdin and his

wonderful ring and lamp, although animals play a part in it
unknown to the Oriental tale. <a href="#chap55">No. 55</a> introduces us to the
singular relations supposed to exist between human beings
and wolves, and <a href="#chap56">No. 56</a> exhibits a curious mixture of destiny
and ingenuity.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap52" id="chap52"></a>LII.&mdash;KRALJEVITCH MARKO.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once upon a time a mother who gave birth to
Kraljevitch Marko. She reared him, and placed him in a
position to become a hero. When Marko was growing up
he was obliged to feed swine, but he was then weakly, and
so dwarfish a lad that his comrades were able to beat him,
and wanted him to be a sort of servant for them and tend
their swine. But he was not willing to do this, so they
beat him and lugged him by the hair, so that he was obliged
to run away from them. He got away, and went into the
fields, and there roamed about, thinking: &lsquo;They would be
beating me all day, now one, now another of them; but as
it is, when I go to them in the evening, they will only beat
me once.&rsquo; As he roamed about, he came up to a baby.
He saw that it was a handsome one, and that it was lying
in the sun. He made it a cool shade with branches, and
went a little way off and sat down. As he thus sat, up came
a Vila, and said to herself: &lsquo;Gracious God! who has done
this? Let him ask me for anything in the world; I will
give it him.&rsquo; He heard this, approached, and said: &lsquo;Sister,
I have done this for you.&rsquo; &lsquo;You have done it, little brother?
Come! what do you ask of me in return, that I may reward
you for being so good as to make a cool shade for my baby?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Ah, dear sister! what I should ask you, you could not
give me.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, what is such a mighty matter? only tell
me.&rsquo; He was thinking of this, that his comrades might not
beat him at the pasture; therefore he said that he should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>267]</a></span>
wish that they should not beat him. She replied: &lsquo;Well,
if that is what you wish for, come and suck my breast.&rsquo;
He obeyed her, went and sucked. When he had finished
sucking, the Vila said to him: &lsquo;Well, go now and heave
yon stone, and try whether you can heave it up.&rsquo; The
stone was twelve hundredweight. He went to heave it, but
could not stir it from its place. Then the Vila said to him:
&lsquo;Come and suck again; when you have done sucking, go
and heave it.&rsquo; He went to suck, and when he had finished,
went to heave it, but only lifted it a little. Then he went
again to suck, with such effect that he could already cast it
a little way. He went to suck once more. Then he was
already able to cast it to a great height and over hills, so
that it was no more to be found. Once more she bade him
come to suck. He sucked his fill, and then she said to
him: &lsquo;Go now whithersoever you will; no one will beat you
any more&mdash;no, not your comrades.&rsquo; He went merrily to the
herdsmen, and they called to him: &lsquo;Where have you been
that we are obliged to tend your swine?&rsquo; and rushed upon
him to beat him. He only waited for them. When they
came up to him, he seized one, knocked them down, and
the one who was in his hands was quite squashed, with
such force had he taken hold of him. The other shepherds,
who saw what he did, ran to the home of those whom he
had knocked down, saying: &lsquo;Marko has knocked down
your son, and so-and-so&rsquo;s, and so-and-so&rsquo;s.&rsquo; They all went to
his mother: &lsquo;What manner of son is this that you have
reared up?&mdash;a brigand, who kills our children!&rsquo; She was
terrified out of her wits, thinking what her son had done.
She began to revile him: &lsquo;Sonny, never did my eye see that
you did anything; wherefore do you thus to me, that other
people come to revile me because of your doings? Go! I
shall be glad if my eye never sees you more. Why do you
put me to shame?&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, then, good! if so you say, I will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>268]</a></span>
go into the world.&rsquo; &lsquo;Only go that I may never see you.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Well, then, good! go I will.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He went. Now, he thought to himself: &lsquo;What shall I
do? I am a hero, but I have not what a hero requires.&rsquo;
Then he went to a smith, at whose smithy were five-and-twenty
smiths. &lsquo;God help you, smith!&rsquo; &lsquo;God help you,
Kraljevitch Marko! why have you come to me?&rsquo; &lsquo;I have
come to you that you may forge me a sword weighing twelve
hundredweight; then you shall also forge me a mace, if you
make the sword well; but you must know that it must be
stronger than your anvil. If it cuts it through, you shall
receive payment; otherwise, not. Have you understood
me?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, then make it now.&rsquo; All five-and-twenty
smiths went immediately and forged the sword.
When it was ready, Marko came. &lsquo;Well, smith, have you
got it ready?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, Marko.&rsquo; &lsquo;Now come, let me see.&rsquo;
Marko struck, but the sword broke into two pieces, and not
the anvil. &lsquo;Ah! friend smith, you&rsquo;ve not done it well;
you get no pay.&rsquo; He went on to another smith. &lsquo;God
help you, smith!&rsquo; &lsquo;God help you, Kraljevitch Marko!
What work do you want done?&rsquo; &lsquo;I have come to you to
make me a sword weighing twelve hundredweight, and to
make it stronger than your anvil, because, if it cuts through
your anvil, you will receive payment; if not, you will get
nothing. Have you understood me?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then make
it.&rsquo; Then up came the thirty smiths, worked at the sword,
and worked until they had finished forging it. Marko came:
&lsquo;Well, smith, is the sword ready?&rsquo; &lsquo;It is, Marko.&rsquo; &lsquo;Show
it me that I may see it.&rsquo; Marko took it, struck, cut through
the anvil, and cut right into the block. &lsquo;Well, smith, you&rsquo;ve
made it well. Now that you&rsquo;ve made me a sword, make me
also a sheath for the sword, and also a club, that is, a mace,
weighing twelve hundredweight, then I will pay you all at
once. But when I throw the mace, it must not break; if it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>269]</a></span>
breaks, then you get no payment.&rsquo; He made him a mace
also, but did not make it well. When Marko threw it, he
let it fall upon himself, and the mace broke. Then said
Marko: &lsquo;You have made me the sword well, but not the
mace. Reach out your hand that I may pay you for the
sword.&rsquo; The smith reached out his hand, and Marko cut it
off with the sword, saying: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s your payment, smith,
for the sword, that you may no more make such swords for
any hero.&rsquo; Then he went to a third smith, with whom
thirty-eight smiths were at work, and said: &lsquo;God help you,
smith!&rsquo; &lsquo;God requite you, Marko! why have you come to
me?&rsquo; &lsquo;I have come to you to make me a club, that is, a
mace, weighing twelve hundredweight; I tell you the truth,
if I throw it up on high, and it breaks when it falls, you get
no payment.&rsquo; All thirty-eight smiths worked till they forged
it. Marko came: &lsquo;Well, is the mace ready?&rsquo; &lsquo;It is, Marko.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Show it, that I may see it.&rsquo; When he gave it him, he threw
it so high into the air that it was three days and three nights
in the sky. When it came down, Marko presented his back;
it fell upon him, and cast him to the ground, and blood
flowed from his nose and teeth, but the mace remained
sound. But Marko sprang up quickly, and said to the
smith: &lsquo;Ah! dear smith! you&rsquo;ve made it well for me;
reach out your hand that I may pay you.&rsquo; He reached out
his hand to him, and he cut his hand off with his sword.
&lsquo;Let this be your payment, smith, that you may no more
make such staves for any hero.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he went off to his mother and said to her: &lsquo;Mother,
you see in me a hero; if you revile me, I shall go about the
world.&rsquo; Then his mother began to scold him: &lsquo;Why are
you like this? Why don&rsquo;t you live like other people? You
have oxen; go, then, on to the green hill and plough the
fallows and pastures, and thereby support your old mother.&rsquo;
Marko obeyed her, took the oxen, and went. But he didn&rsquo;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>270]</a></span>
go on to the green hill, to plough the fallows and pastures,
but he went and ploughed the emperor&rsquo;s highroads. When
the Turks saw this, they went to Marko&mdash;three hundred
Turks, all chosen warriors&mdash;and said to him: &lsquo;Why, Marko,
do you plough the emperor&rsquo;s highroads? you have the
fallows and pastures!&rsquo; Then at him, to cut him down.
When Marko saw this, he hadn&rsquo;t with him either his sword
or his mace, so seized his plough and felled all three
hundred Turks. Then said he: &lsquo;Ah! gracious God! a
wondrous hero!&rsquo; Then he took the Turks&rsquo; gold from them,
left his plough, unyoked the oxen, and turned them loose on
the green hill: &lsquo;Go, little oxen, on to the green hill, and
feed and graze from pine to pine, like the cuckoo; Marko
has not managed to plough with you, and now never will he
more.&rsquo; And home he went singing: &lsquo;Here, mother, you
have gold enough, live upon it, and I will go into the
world, that your eye may see me no more.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He took his mace and sword, went and came to an inn,
where some Turks were drinking red wine and conversing.
&lsquo;We should be glad to make the acquaintance of Kraljevitch
Marko and see him. We have heard that he is a celebrated
hero. His brother Andro is in Stambol here. He is a
hero, but they say that <em>he</em> is a still greater hero.&rsquo; &lsquo;In whose
service is Andro Kraljevitch?&rsquo; &lsquo;In that of a pasha; he
will soon come riding past here.&rsquo; &lsquo;Good; I will wait for
him.&rsquo; Up came Andro Kraljevitch, riding with the pasha.
Marko called out to him: &lsquo;Eh, adopted brother, Kraljevitch
Andro!&rsquo; &lsquo;Thanks, unknown hero, perhaps you are Kraljevitch
Marko?&rsquo; &lsquo;Quite true, I am Kraljevitch Marko.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Good; let us go into the inn to drink a cup of wine, that
love and the fortune of heroes may thus unite us. Now we
are not afraid of going into combat against any empire.&rsquo;
So they went on the way to an inn. Kraljevitch Marko
said: &lsquo;Prithee, sing me a song, Andro.&rsquo; &lsquo;Dear brother, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>271]</a></span>
dare not. The Vila of the cloud would shoot me.&rsquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
be afraid; I am here.&rsquo; Andro obeyed, and sang so that all
the branches began to fall. All at once a spear flew against
Andro and struck him down. Marko looked about to see
whence it came, and espied a Vila in the cloud; he seized
his mace and threw it at the Vila, so that it at once struck
her to the ground. The Vila began to shriek: &lsquo;Let me go,
Marko! I will bring Andro back to life, and will give you
a wondrous horse, so that you will be able to fly in the
air.&rsquo; Marko agreed, and she took certain grasses, and
brought Andro back to life. Marko obtained the wondrous
horse, and both rode off to an inn and drank red wine.
But in the inn there was a wicked harlot. She became
enamoured of Andro, but he would not even look at her.
She therefore put sweet honey into his wine, that he might
drink the wine. Marko went out for a short time, and the
wicked woman murdered Andro. But when Marko came in
he seized the wicked woman, and spitted her on his sword:
&lsquo;Take that, wretch, for murdering my brother Andro.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He went on into the world. He roamed hither and
thither, and when he met with any hero, he tried the fortune
of combat with him, as in his encounter with black Arapin.
Arapin built a tower beside the level sea. When he had
built it handsomely and raised it high, he said thus to it:
&lsquo;Handsomely, my tower, handsomely have I built thee, and
high have I raised thee, for I have no father nor mother, no
brother nor sister, nor even my beloved, to walk about in
thee. But I have a love, the daughter of the emperor
Soliman. I will write him the leaf of a white book, and
send up to him by a black Tatar; for if he will not give her
to me, let him meet me in single combat.&rsquo; He wrote the
leaf of a white book and sent it by a black Tatar. When
Soliman read over the leaf of the white book, he shed tears
abundantly, and his empress Solimanitza came to him and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>272]</a></span>
questioned him: &lsquo;Why do you weep, emperor Soliman?
Ofttimes have letters come for you, and you have not shed
abundant tears; what distress is tormenting you?&rsquo; He told
her this, that black Arapin had written to him, that, if he
did not give him his daughter, he must meet him in single
combat; and how could he meet him in single combat?
She advised him to write the leaf of a white book to Kraljevitch
Marko to come, promising to give him three loads of
money. He wrote the leaf of a white book and sent it by a
black Tatar. When Kraljevitch Marko read over the leaf
of the book, he began to laugh greatly: &lsquo;Yes, i&rsquo; faith,
emperor Soliman! what will your money do for me, if
black Arapin severs my head from my shoulders?&rsquo; And he
said not whether he would go or not go. The emperor
Soliman was anxiously expecting the Tatar, who brought to
him the words, that Marko neither said that he would come,
nor that he would not come. Thereupon the emperor was
sorrowful, for he had no such man who would deliver his
daughter. There arrived a second letter from black Arapin,
that he must give him his daughter; if he did not give her,
he must meet him in single combat. As he read it, he
shed abundant tears. Thereupon his only daughter came
to him and asked him: &lsquo;Why do you weep, emperor
Soliman? Letters have ofttimes arrived for you, and you
have not shed abundant tears.&rsquo; He replied to her: &lsquo;Dear
daughter! You see that black Arapin writes to me, that,
if I do not give you to him, I must meet him in single
combat; and how shall I, poor man that I am, meet him?&rsquo;
&lsquo;You know, dear father, that there is one hero, Kraljevitch
Marko. Write to him, that you will give him nine loads of
money, if he will come and meet him in single combat.&rsquo;
The emperor Soliman wrote to Kraljevitch Marko the leaf of
a white book, and sent it to him by a black Tatar. When
he read over the leaf of the white book he laughed greatly:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>273]</a></span>
&lsquo;I&rsquo; faith, emperor Soliman! what will your money be to
me, if black Arapin severs my head from my shoulders?&rsquo;
Thereupon he did not say whether he would come or not
come. Sorrowful thereat, the emperor did not know what
to do. Then came a third letter from black Arapin, that
he was coming, and that he must prepare, would he, nould
he, to give him his daughter, and that all inns and shops
must be shut for fear of him. Thereupon the emperor
Soliman shed abundant tears as he read it. His daughter
came to him: &lsquo;Why do you weep, emperor Soliman?
Letters have ofttimes arrived for you, and you have not
shed abundant tears. What distress is assailing you?&rsquo; &lsquo;You
see, dear daughter, that black Arapin writes to me, that if
I don&rsquo;t give you to him, I must meet him in single combat!
But how shall I, poor man, meet him?&rsquo; &lsquo;Write, dear
father, to Kraljevitch Marko to come, and offer him twelve
loads of money, and a shirt which is neither spun nor
woven nor bleached, but made of nothing but pure gold,
and a serpent that holds a tray in its mouth, and on the
tray a golden casket, and in the casket a precious stone, by
aid of which you can sup at midnight just as well as at
mid-day.&rsquo; He wrote the leaf of a white book and sent it to
Kraljevitch Marko by a black Tatar, and offered him all
that his daughter told him. When Marko read the leaf of
the white book, he laughed greatly, and said: &lsquo;I&rsquo; faith,
emperor Soliman! what will your money do for me, if
black Arapin severs my head from my shoulders?&rsquo; And
then, too, he did not say that he would come or not come.
Thereupon came the leaf of a white book from black
Arapin, that Arapin had now got ready three hundred
heroes, all in silver armour, and all chosen warriors. Then
said Kraljevitch Marko to his piebald horse: &lsquo;Eh! piebald
horse, my pearl! you know well that you must be faithful
to me, for, if not, I shall cut off your feet at the knees, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>274]</a></span>
that you must bear yourself valiantly.&rsquo; And the piebald
horse replied that he must saddle and mount with speed to
go soon, and that black Arapin was already near. Marko
saddled and mounted him, and went to the city where the
emperor Soliman reigned.</p>

<p>Now, when he had ascertained by which road Arapin&rsquo;s
men were coming, he presented himself to a young innkeeper,
and said, knocking at the door: &lsquo;Open, and bring
some wine.&rsquo; But he excused himself, saying that he dared
not draw any, for all inns and shops were obliged to be shut
for fear of black Arapin. But the hero said to him: &lsquo;You
must bring some for me, or I shall cleave your head to the
shoulders.&rsquo; The innkeeper saw that it could not be otherwise,
and was obliged to bring him a cup of wine. Marko
drank half, and gave half to his piebald horse. Then he
brought two cups, one for Marko, and one for the horse.
Meanwhile, Marko went into the garden to look about him.
When he got there, he saw by the side of a brook a damsel
in sorrow, and wondered what ailed her that she wept so
piteously, saying: &lsquo;Ah! my rivulet! I would rather abide
in you, than lie behind black Arapin&rsquo;s back.&rsquo; When Marko
saw that it was Soliman&rsquo;s daughter, he said: &lsquo;What ails you,
damsel, that you weep so piteously?&rsquo; She replied to him:
&lsquo;Go hence, unknown hero! As to what you ask me, you
cannot aid me.&rsquo; &lsquo;Now, only tell me; maybe I shall aid
you.&rsquo; &lsquo;Black Arapin will come, and will take me away
from my father and mother; but I had a man, who could
have set me free, but he will not. I offered him twelve
loads of money, and a shirt, which is neither spun nor
bleached, but is made of pure gold; and a serpent, that
holds in its mouth a tray, and on the tray a golden casket,
and in the casket a precious stone, by aid of which he could
sup at midnight, as well as at mid-day; but he won&rsquo;t. The
sun has not seen him, neither has the moon thrown its light
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>275]</a></span>
upon him, nor has he seen his mother more, nor has a bird
sung to him.&rsquo; Marko answered her: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t chatter, don&rsquo;t
chatter; but go and say that I have arrived. I am Marko;
and let him dress and furnish you handsomely, and give you
all that is requisite for Arapin, and all that he shall desire.&rsquo;
Then she ran to her father, and told him all that Marko
said. Meanwhile, while Marko was conversing with the
damsel, Arapin arrived, saw an inn open, and a horse in
front of it standing tethered at the entrance. He said:
&lsquo;Who is this, that is not afraid of my terror?&rsquo; And thereupon
he said that he would soon teach him to be afraid of
him. After this, he shouted an order to the bedelija; the
bedelija (such is the [Turkish] name for a horse) would not
stir. &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go thither; I won&rsquo;t make quarrels; maybe
I shall obtain possession of the damsel without any disturbance.&rsquo;
And, in fact, thither he went, obtained possession of
the damsel, and all that he needed was given him. Then
he went again to the inn, and saw the horse again standing
there. Again he was about to go to the innkeeper to slay
him; but he shouted to the horse, the horse wouldn&rsquo;t stir.
Said Arapin: &lsquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t make quarrels, now that I have
obtained the damsel without any quarrel.&rsquo; When Arapin
proceeded on his way, Marko came out of the garden, and
his piebald horse said to him: &lsquo;Where have you been so
long, that Arapin might easily have killed me?&rsquo; &lsquo;Now
don&rsquo;t fear, my piebald; we shall soon kill him, please God,
not he you.&rsquo; Then he called for one more cup of wine for
himself, and one for his piebald. When they had finished
drinking, they started on their way, and in pursuit of Arapin.
Arapin had already told his chief officer to look round to
see whether any dark fog came out behind them. He looked
round, but saw nothing. But when he afterwards looked
round a second time, he espied a dark fog, and said to
Arapin: &lsquo;Yes, my lord, a dark foul fog is coming behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>276]</a></span>
us.&rsquo; Scarcely had he said this, when Marko attacked, and
began to slaughter, his rearguard. Arapin said to him:
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Marko; why are you playing the fool with
us? I don&rsquo;t know whether you are jesting, or playing the
fool.&rsquo; &lsquo;I am neither jesting nor playing the fool, but am in
earnest.&rsquo; &lsquo;Do, then, what you can; throw what you have.&rsquo;
&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t; but throw you your mace.&rsquo; Marko&rsquo;s piebald
threw himself down, and Arapin&rsquo;s mace went over Marko&rsquo;s
head. Then Marko threw his mace, and felled Arapin to
the ground, and the piebald leapt to Arapin, and said to
Marko: &lsquo;Come, see that you cut off Arapin&rsquo;s head.&rsquo; When
the piebald leapt, Marko, too, struck with his sword, and
cut off Arapin&rsquo;s head, and the piebald quickly leapt backwards
thirty paces. Then he left Arapin&rsquo;s carcase on the
ground, gave the head to the damsel, and said: &lsquo;Kiss him,
now that he is dead, though you wouldn&rsquo;t when he was
living.&rsquo; They went home, and the emperor caused a great
entertainment to be prepared, and all Marko&rsquo;s friends, and
his father and mother, to be invited, and Marko obtained his
promised reward.</p>

<p>So, too, he tried the fortune of combat with Musa
Urbanusa.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> He had three hearts. Marko fought with him
for three nights and three white days without cessation, so
that red foam already issued from Marko, while not even
white foam came from Musa Urbanusa. Then Kraljevitch
Marko shouted: &lsquo;Eh! sister Vila!&rsquo; The Vila replied: &lsquo;I
cannot help you, because the baby has fallen asleep in my
arms; but don&rsquo;t you know your secret weapon?&rsquo; Then
said Kraljevitch Marko: &lsquo;Look, Musa Urbanusa, whether
the sun is now rising or setting.&rsquo; Musa looked at the sun,
and Marko drew his knife, and ripped Musa up. Musa
seized hold of him so powerfully that he barely dug his way
out from under Musa, whom he had ripped up. There he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>277]</a></span>
lay, and Marko pushed himself sideways, and when he had
extricated himself, went to look what there was in this man
that was so strong. He saw that Musa had three hearts,
one was beating, the second was beginning to beat a little,
and the third did not yet know aught about it. On the
third he saw a snake lying, and the snake said to Marko:
&lsquo;Thank God that I didn&rsquo;t know of it; you wouldn&rsquo;t have
done what you have done. But open your mouth, Marko,
that I may enter into you, that you, too, may be as strong as
he was.&rsquo; Marko became angry, and cut the snake to pieces,
saying: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t need such a foul creature as you are.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_19_19">[19]</a></span>
Musa, the Albanian, more properly Arbanasian.</p>
</div>

<p>Then he proceeded on his way, and went about till firearms
were invented. He went up to a shepherd, who was
shooting birds. Then Marko asked him: &lsquo;What&rsquo;s this that
you are doing?&rsquo; &lsquo;Eh! you see, I&rsquo;m shooting birds; and I
could shoot you, also.&rsquo; &lsquo;And how would you kill me with
this thing? Heroes have not killed me; could you do so?&rsquo;
Then he reached his hand to him, and said: &lsquo;Shoot into
my hand here.&rsquo; He shot, and shot through his hand. Then
said Marko: &lsquo;It is not worth my while to live any longer
in the world; now any cuckoo could slay me; I had rather
quit it.&rsquo; He went into a cavern, and lives there still at the
present day. Into this cavern a man was compelled to go,
who was let down by a rope in a chest. When he arrived
within, the Vila immediately stepped up to him, and said:
&lsquo;Christian soul, why come you here?&rsquo; He told her why
and how. But Marko heard that somebody was conversing,
and immediately asked the Vila who it was that had come
in. She told him that a soul from that world had come to
see what was in the cavern. Marko immediately said that
he must come to him, that he might see how strong people
in the world still were, and he must give him his hand.
But she gave him a red-hot iron, and Marko took it, and
squeezed it in his hands so that water spirted out of it, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>278]</a></span>
said: &lsquo;Ah, ah! I could still live in the world if no one
would talk about me for three days.&rsquo; He also commissioned
him to tell the lords that he should come there. He gave
him a letter, too, and sealed it with his own hand, and
allowed him to go up. He shook the rope, and got into
the chest. Then they pulled him up, and he gave the letter
to the lords; but, for fear of Marko&rsquo;s coming, the lords did
not make the letter public for people to know how Marko
had gone into the cavern. The footprints of his horse are
still recognised.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap53" id="chap53"></a>LIII.&mdash;THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF THE VILAS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a mother, who was expecting. As she once
upon a time came out of church from mass, her pains fell
upon her. Whither should she go? She concealed herself
under a bridge, and became the happy mother of a son.
The three Royenitzes also came thither. They are hags,
who determine by what death every child is to pass from
this world. One said: &lsquo;Let us kill him at once.&rsquo; The
second said: &lsquo;Not so; but when he grows up, then let us
kill him, that his mother&rsquo;s sorrow for him may be greater.&rsquo;
But the third said: &lsquo;Let us not do so; but if he does not
take the daughter of the king of the Vilas to wife, then let
us kill him.&rsquo; And so it was settled.</p>

<p>When he had grown up, he said to his mother: &lsquo;Mamma,
I should like to marry.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah, my son, you say that you
would like to marry; but there is no one to be married to
you.&rsquo; He asked her: &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; She told him: &lsquo;Yes;
the Suyenitzes have pronounced your fate, that if you do not
take the daughter of the king of the Vilas to wife, they will
put you to death.&rsquo; He then said: &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go in search
of her; but first I&rsquo;ll go to ask a certain old smith; maybe
he&rsquo;ll be able to tell me where she is.&rsquo; The smith said:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>279]</a></span>
&lsquo;My son, it will be difficult for you to find out; but go to
the mother of the moon; if she can&rsquo;t tell you, I don&rsquo;t know
who will be better able to tell you than she.&rsquo; He also gave
him three pairs of iron shoes, and sent him off to the mother
of the moon. &lsquo;Only, when you come to her, take her by
the arm, then she will ask you at once what you want, and
tell her without delay.&rsquo; He went off, and just as he was on
the point of wearing out the shoes, he came to the moon&rsquo;s
mother, and took her by the arm. She asked him immediately
what he wanted. He said: &lsquo;I want to find the
daughter of the king of the Vilas.&rsquo; She said: &lsquo;Well, my
son, I don&rsquo;t know; but maybe my son knows. Wait till
he comes home, and then you can ask him. But he mustn&rsquo;t
find you; he would tear you to pieces at once. When he
comes home, he will notice that you are here. I will conceal
you, and when he asks for the third time where the
Christian soul is, then say to him: &ldquo;Here I am!&rdquo; and he
won&rsquo;t be able to do anything to you.&rsquo; The old woman hid
him under a trough. The moon came home, and asked:
&lsquo;Mamma, you have a Christian soul here.&rsquo; And when he
asked for the third time where the Christian soul was, he
announced himself: &lsquo;Here I am.&rsquo; And then he could
do nothing to him, otherwise he would have crushed him
to powder. He asked him what he wanted. He said: &lsquo;I
want to find the daughter of the king of the Vilas.&rsquo; The
moon: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but if the sun&rsquo;s mother doesn&rsquo;t
know, I don&rsquo;t know who else does.&rsquo; And he showed him
the way by which he must go.</p>

<p>He put on the second pair of shoes, and when he was just on
the point of wearing them out, he came to the sun&rsquo;s mother,
and took her by the arm. She said to him at once: &lsquo;What
do you want?&rsquo; He said to her that, if she knew where the
Vilas&rsquo; castles were, he wanted to obtain the daughter of the
king of the Vilas. She then said to him: &lsquo;Ah, my son, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>280]</a></span>
don&rsquo;t know; but if my son doesn&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know who
else does. Wait a little till he comes home.&rsquo; She, too,
concealed him under a trough, and he announced himself
the third time that the sun asked: &lsquo;Mother, you have a
Christian soul here:&rsquo; saying, &lsquo;Here I am.&rsquo; Neither could
the sun do anything to him, but asked him what he wanted.
He replied that he was in search of the Vilas&rsquo; castles, and
the daughter of the king of the Vilas. Then the sun said
to him: &lsquo;Ah, I don&rsquo;t know; but if the storm-mare (that is,
the storm or wind) doesn&rsquo;t know, then I don&rsquo;t know who
will know.&rsquo; Then he showed him the road, and said: &lsquo;When
you come to a meadow where the grass is up to your knees,
there the storm-mare is. If you don&rsquo;t find her there, wait
for her; she will come to feed. Don&rsquo;t go directly to her,
but hide behind a tree or in a hole, and when she comes,
take her at once by the bridle, otherwise it will not be good
for you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He went off, and put on the third pair of shoes, then
went and went, and arrived at the meadow. When he got
there, the storm-mare was not there till dawn. He hid himself
under a bridge, and when she came to the bridge to
drink water, he seized her by the bridle, and she asked him
what he wanted. He replied that he wanted to find the
daughter of the king of the Vilas. She answered him:
&lsquo;Mount on my back.&rsquo; He mounted, and she then said to
him: &lsquo;But you mustn&rsquo;t fall off.&rsquo; She reared; he almost
fell off, but kept himself on with his foot. She reared a
second time, and then, too, he almost fell off. A third
time she reared, and then, too, he almost fell off, only he
kept himself on with his knee. Then she said to him:
&lsquo;This will be harmful to me.&rsquo; She went off with him like a
bird, and sped and sped up to two steps. When she came
near them, the steps split in twain from the gust, but speedily
closed again, and tore off a piece of the mare&rsquo;s tail. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>281]</a></span>
the mare said to him: &lsquo;You see how you harmed me when
you almost fell off.&rsquo; Then they went on till they arrived at
the Vilas&rsquo; castles. Then she said: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t get drunk or
forget, so as not to come to me.&rsquo; He said that he would
come, and went off upwards. They received and entertained
him, and he asked them at once to give him the
king&rsquo;s daughter. They promised that they would give her
to him. Then they feasted, and ate and drank till darkness
came on. And when evening arrived, he said that he must
go out on his own account, and would return directly. He
went off to the storm-mare. They had brought her a
hundred quintals of hay. He concealed himself in the
mare&rsquo;s tail. They sought him, and couldn&rsquo;t find him; but
nevertheless they almost found him at dawn; but a cock
began to crow, and then they could do nothing to him.
Afterwards he went indoors, and they gave him again to eat
and drink, and asked him where he had been. He replied:
&lsquo;I slept under a hedge; I fell down, and soon fell asleep on
the spot.&rsquo; They gave the mare a hundred quintals of hay
and several measures of oats. They enjoyed themselves the
whole day till evening. He went out again and hid himself
in the mare&rsquo;s mane. They sought him all night long, but
couldn&rsquo;t find him; but at dawn an old witch told them that
he was in the mane. They would almost have found him
there, but the cocks began to crow, and they couldn&rsquo;t kill
him now. But afterwards they killed all the cocks in the
whole village. He went again into the castle. They gave
him what he wanted to eat and drink, and the mare, as
usual, a hundred quintals of hay and several measures of
oats, and said to him: &lsquo;You must not go out anywhere in
the evening; we will prepare everything for you that you
require.&rsquo; When evening came, they were on friendly terms
with him, but nevertheless dispersed. He went out, and
went to the mare. Where did she bestow him? She hid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>282]</a></span>
him under her foot in her shoe, for she had a large foot.
They went to seek him again. But during the day he took
two eggs, and the mare hatched them by evening in her
throat, and they had almost grown up by evening. When
they sought him again, they couldn&rsquo;t find him. At dawn
they consulted the old witch. She told them that he was
under the mare&rsquo;s hoof. They wanted now to take him out,
but the cockerels which the mare had hatched in her throat
began to crow. They could do nothing to him, but they
wrung the two cockerels&rsquo; necks. Now he said that they
must give him the king&rsquo;s daughter, that he might depart.
But the king said that he wouldn&rsquo;t give her to him, because
he had not slept where he had prepared a bed for him.
He declared that he had been drunk and had gone out, had
fallen down, and gone to sleep on the spot. But the king
would not believe him. Now he begged him to bring his
daughter to him, that he might at any rate give her a kiss.
But beforehand the mare instructed him that, when she
came to kiss him, he was to seize her and pull her on to her
(the mare), and they would escape with her. And he was
also to take a brush with which horses are cleaned, a comb
with which horses are combed, and a glass of water, and
make good preparations for himself. But when the king
granted his request that his daughter should come for him
to kiss her, she stood on his foot in the stirrup, and as she
stood to give the kiss, off started the mare, and made her
way through the gate, and on and on she went. The king
saw this, called for his horse, and after them. They were
already far on their way. All of a sudden the mare said:
&lsquo;Look round to see whether anyone is coming behind us.&rsquo;
He looked round and said: &lsquo;There is; he is all but catching
you by the tail.&rsquo; The mare said: &lsquo;Throw the brush!&rsquo;
He threw the brush, and a forest placed itself behind them,
so that he could scarcely make his way through; the poor
king could scarcely get through for thorn bushes. And they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>283]</a></span>
had meanwhile got a long way forward. The king, however,
forced his way through, and again after them with speed,
till he was again on the point of catching them. Then the
mare said: &lsquo;Look round to see whether anyone is coming
behind us.&rsquo; He looked round and saw that he was already
near, and the mare was all but caught by the tail, and said:
&lsquo;He is near, and you are all but caught by the tail.&rsquo; The
mare said: &lsquo;Throw the comb.&rsquo; He threw it, and a great
chain of mountains, one after the other, placed itself there;
and on they went further, so that they had already gone a
great space, and the king with difficulty made his way over
the mountains, and again after them, so that he was again
on the point of overtaking them. The mare told him to
look round to see whether anyone was coming behind them.
He said that there was, and that she was all but caught by
the tail. The mare said: &lsquo;Throw the glass with water.&rsquo;
He threw it, and a great flood of water arose, so that the
king could with difficulty get across. And they had already
got a long way on. No sooner had the king got out of the
water, when on he went with speed, with speed, again after
them, and was already on the point of overtaking them,
when the mare was already near the steps, and the steps
opened from the gust of wind, and the mare sped through,
and they closed again, and the king couldn&rsquo;t proceed further
through the steps, and shouted loudly: &lsquo;Son-in-law, don&rsquo;t
go any further; I cannot do so. Let not my daughter complain
that I have given her nothing.&rsquo; Then he somehow
threw his girdle over the steps, for he had nought else to
give her save that girdle. And the girdle was such that
whatsoever its owner wanted, he obtained. Then the king
returned, and they remained happy. He thanked the storm-mare
courteously, and went home with speed, for he bade
the girdle place them at his house. They prepared a grand
banquet, for they had plenty, and I was at the banquet and
feasted.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap54" id="chap54"></a>LIV.&mdash;THE WONDER-WORKING LOCK.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once upon a time a woman who had one son.
This son maintained himself and his mother; he fed their
one cow, and brought wood and carried it to the town for
sale, and with the money bought bread to support his
mother and himself. On one occasion he carried sticks to
market, and bought bread and went homewards. As he
went homewards with the bread, he went through a wood,
came up to some shepherds, and saw that they were going
to kill a puppy, and said to them: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t kill it; the poor
animal has done you no wrong; give it rather to me.&rsquo; The
shepherds said to him: &lsquo;What will you give us? Give us
that loaf.&rsquo; He gave them the loaf, took the dog, and carried
it home. When he got home, his mother asked him:
&lsquo;Have you brought any bread?&rsquo; &lsquo;No, but I have bought a
puppy with the bread.&rsquo; She then said: &lsquo;Wherewith shall
we support it, when we&rsquo;ve nothing to eat ourselves?&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,
I&rsquo;ll go gather sticks, sell them, and buy bread.&rsquo; He went a
second time to gather sticks, took them and sold them, then
bought bread, went through the wood, and saw where the
shepherds were killing a kitten, and said to them: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
kill the animal; it has done you no harm; rather give it
to me?&rsquo; They said to him: &lsquo;What will you give us?&rsquo; He
said: &lsquo;What should I give you, when I&rsquo;ve got nothing?&rsquo;
The shepherds said: &lsquo;That loaf of bread.&rsquo; He gave it
them and carried the kitten home. The old woman was
again anxiously expecting bread. When he got home his
mother said to him: &lsquo;Do you bring me any bread?&rsquo; &lsquo;No,
but I&rsquo;ve bought a kitten with the bread.&rsquo; The old woman
then said: &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve nothing to eat yourself, much less the
cat.&rsquo; He then said: &lsquo;It, too, will be serviceable. I&rsquo;ll go
gather sticks, sell them, and buy bread.&rsquo; He went a third
time, gathered and sold sticks, bought bread, and went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>285]</a></span>
homewards. Going through the wood, he saw the shepherds
killing a snake, and said: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t kill the snake, it has done
you no harm; why should you kill it?&rsquo; He begged for it,
too, because he compassionated it; it was beautifully marked,
and he fancied it. Then said the shepherds: &lsquo;What will
you give us not to kill it?&rsquo; He said: &lsquo;This little loaf of
bread.&rsquo; He gave it them, and they gave him the snake. He
went home with the snake, and the snake said to him: &lsquo;Now
feed me; when I grow up you shall carry me home.&rsquo; When
he got home his mother said to him: &lsquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you
brought some bread? Why have you brought this?&rsquo; He
said: &lsquo;It, too, will be of service.&rsquo; Then he went a fourth
time to gather sticks, took them to market, sold them,
bought four loaves of bread, and brought them home.
Then they all ate their fill&mdash;the dog, the cat, the snake, his
mother, and himself. He maintained the whole set of
animals. The snake grew big; he now carried it home.
It said to him: &lsquo;Do you hear? my mother will offer you
gold and silver, but don&rsquo;t take any, but let her give you the
lock which hangs behind the door. Whenever you want
anything whatever, only knock on the lock; twelve young
men will come, who will ask you: &ldquo;What are your commands?&rdquo;
Only say what you wish for, and you will have
it immediately.&rsquo; When he carried it home, its parents
asked him what he wanted for bringing their daughter home.
He said according to his instructions: &lsquo;Nothing but that
lock, which hangs behind the door.&rsquo; They said to him:
&lsquo;We can&rsquo;t give you that; and what good would you do
yourself with the lock? Let us rather give you a quantity
of money, as much as you can carry.&rsquo; He then said: &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t wish for your money; only give me the lock.&rsquo; When
they long refused to give it him, he was about to depart.
But they saw that he ought not to go away without payment,
so gave him the lock. Now, when he had obtained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>286]</a></span>
the lock, and had gone a little distance from the house, he
knocked on the lock, and immediately out came twelve
young men, who asked him: &lsquo;What are your commands?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Only that you place me at home at once.&rsquo; He immediately
stood in front of his cottage, and when his mother saw him,
she rejoiced: &lsquo;Oh, my son! you have come home; how
miserable I have been because you were not at home!&rsquo;
&lsquo;Well, mamma, don&rsquo;t talk! we shall now live better than
we have done hitherto; I have brought you such a thing,
that we shall live with ease.&rsquo; Then he gently knocked on
the lock, and up darted the twelve young men: &lsquo;What are
your commands?&rsquo; &lsquo;Food and drink for me, my mother,
the dog and the cat.&rsquo; And so it was. This pleased the
old woman, and she loved her son still more.</p>

<p>Now it came into his head that he should like to get
married, and he said to his mother: &lsquo;Mamma, go you to
our king, and ask him to give me his daughter to wife.&rsquo; His
mother jeered him: &lsquo;What is this nonsense that you are
talking?&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, go you to the king and tell him!&rsquo; The
old woman did not venture to go at once; but at last go
she did, and told the king that her son wished to marry his
daughter. The king said to her: &lsquo;Good! provided he performs
for me what I shall command him; if he breaks up
these hills by to-morrow morning, as far as my eyes can see,
so that the best wheat shall grow, and I shall eat a cake
from it to-morrow, then it is good; if that shall not be done,
he will lose his head.&rsquo; She went home weeping: &lsquo;My son,
you have done an evil thing; the king has said to you, you
must break up all these hills by to-morrow morning, as far
as the king&rsquo;s eyes can see, so that the best wheat shall grow
there, and the king shall eat a cake from it to-morrow; and
if that be not done, you will lose your head.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,
mamma, if that&rsquo;s all he said, then she will be mine.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah!
my sonny! how can this be? You cannot do it.&rsquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>287]</a></span>
talk, mamma, but let us go to sleep; you will see whether
all will be ready to-morrow or no.&rsquo; They took their supper,
and his mother went off to sleep. Then he knocked on the
lock, and out sprang the twelve young men. &lsquo;What are
your commands?&rsquo; &lsquo;I ask that these hills be broken up, as far
as the king&rsquo;s eyes can see, and the best wheat must grow
there.&rsquo; It was done. In the morning the old woman went
to the king with the cake. The king rose up and saw that
it was really accomplished, and the old woman was waiting
with the cake. The king came out, and she said to him:
&lsquo;Good-morning; I have brought it.&rsquo; Then the king said:
&lsquo;Good! he has done this; now tell him that by to-morrow
he must clear all the woods, as far as he can see, and the
best vineyards must be there, and he&rsquo; (the king) &lsquo;must eat
grapes and drink new wine to-morrow; and if he does not
do this, he will lose his head.&rsquo; She went again weeping
home, and told her son all that the king had said to her.
But he only smiled and said: &lsquo;Well, well, only go to sleep,
you will see whether all will be ready to-morrow or no.&rsquo;
When they had supped, the old woman went off to sleep,
and he knocked on the lock, and the twelve young men
sprang out: &lsquo;What are your commands?&rsquo; &lsquo;I command
that these woods be all cleared, and that they produce the
best grapes.&rsquo; This, too, was done. In the morning the
king rose up and saw that the change was really effected.
The old woman, too, was really waiting for him with grapes
and new wine. The king said to her: &lsquo;Well, good! tell
your son that he must accomplish one thing more, and then
he will win my daughter. If he shall have as much cattle,
and such a castle as I have, he will win my daughter; if
not, he will lose his head.&rsquo; The old woman went home
again, and told him what the king said. Then he knocked
on the lock, and immediately out sprang the twelve young
men: &lsquo;What are your commands?&rsquo; He ordered that by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>288]</a></span>
the morrow a better castle must be built than the king had
ever seen, and that he must have more cattle than the king,
and there must be a covered way from his castle to the
king&rsquo;s, and that a better garden must be formed, and in it
all kinds of trees, and all sorts of birds to sing in it. This,
too, came to pass. On the morrow he caused his six best
horses to be harnessed, and went to fetch the king&rsquo;s daughter,
to go to the wedding. Then the king said that there should
be wedding festivities for five years. They were married,
and the wedding festivities took place. Entrance was free
to everyone. The festivities had already lasted three years,
when the king&rsquo;s resources were exhausted. Then said
the young man: &lsquo;Now I will entertain for three years.&rsquo;
The king of the sea came, too, to the festivities, and fancied
the king&rsquo;s daughter, whom the other had married. Once
upon a time he saw how he knocked upon the lock, and
that which he wanted immediately presented itself. When
they went to sleep, the king of the sea stole the lock, and
knocked upon it; up sprang the twelve young men: &lsquo;What
are your commands?&rsquo; &lsquo;That this castle and this lady be
placed on the black sea.&rsquo; It was done. In the morning
the young man and his mother were terrified out of their
wits, because they were lying in a simple cottage. But he
knew at once that he had lost the lock. Then he went to
the king and prayed him to take charge of his mother, that
he might go to look for his castle. Well, he went to look
for it, with his dog and cat. He approached that sea, saw
his castle, and said: &lsquo;Cat and dog, do you see our castle?
But how shall we get into it?&rsquo; They went to the sea and
sat down. He was weary, and fell asleep as he sat. Then
said the dog and the cat: &lsquo;Let us go for the lock.&rsquo; The
dog said: &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t swim; sit on my back; I will carry
you.&rsquo; They went and came up to the wall. Then said the
dog: &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t climb up a wall.&rsquo; The cat said to him:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>289]</a></span>
&lsquo;You hang on somehow behind me.&rsquo; And thus they arrived
at the corridor. Now said the cat: &lsquo;You, dog, stay outside;
I&rsquo;ll go in by myself.&rsquo; The king of the sea had just such a
cat. The cat went to the door and mewed: &lsquo;Miau.&rsquo; Then
said the king of the sea: &lsquo;Let the cat in.&rsquo; Then the cat
went in and took the lock so neatly that the king of the sea
didn&rsquo;t see it; he then went to the door and mewed: &lsquo;Miau.&rsquo;
Then said the king of the sea: &lsquo;Let the cat out.&rsquo; The cat
went out, and the dog asked it: &lsquo;Have you got it?&rsquo; &lsquo;I
have; only go.&rsquo; They went over the wall and into the sea;
and when they were already not far from their master, the
dog wanted to have hold of the lock, to carry it up to his
master, and said to the cat: &lsquo;Give me the lock; if you
don&rsquo;t, I will throw you into the sea.&rsquo; Then they squabbled,
and the lock fell into the sea, and a fish swallowed it; but
the cat seized the fish, and said: &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t give up the
lock I will kill you.&rsquo; The fish said: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t kill me; I&rsquo;ll
give you the lock,&rsquo; and immediately brought the lock up.
They went to their master, and carried up the lock. When
their master awoke and rose up, he said: &lsquo;In what condition
have you come?&rsquo; They said: &lsquo;Our master, we have
brought the lock.&rsquo; &lsquo;Where is it?&rsquo; &lsquo;Here.&rsquo; Then he took
it and knocked upon it, and out sprang the twelve young
men: &lsquo;What are your commands?&rsquo; &lsquo;I command that my
castle be placed where it was, as well as that king and my
wife.&rsquo; It was done. Then he went into the castle, and
she immediately ran to him and they kissed each other.
But he caused the king of the sea to be impaled on a spit
in the midst of the sea. Thus he obtained his castle back
again, and lived happily with his wife, but the king of the
sea was destroyed.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap55" id="chap55"></a>LV.&mdash;THE SHE-WOLF.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was an enchanted mill, so that no one could stay there,
because a she-wolf always haunted it. A soldier went once
into the mill to sleep. He made a fire in the parlour, went
up into the garret above, bored a hole with an auger in the
floor, and peeped down into the parlour. A she-wolf came in
and looked about the mill to see whether she could find anything
to eat. She found nothing, and then went to the fire,
and said: &lsquo;Skin down! skin down! skin down!&rsquo; She raised
herself upon her hind-legs, and her skin fell down. She
took the skin, and hung it on a peg, and out of the wolf
came a damsel. The damsel went to the fire, and fell
asleep there. He came down from the garret, took the
skin, nailed it fast to the mill-wheel, then came into the mill,
shouted over her, and said: &lsquo;Good-morning, damsel! how
do you do?&rsquo; She began to scream: &lsquo;Skin on me! skin on
me! skin on me!&rsquo; But the skin could not come down, for
it was fast nailed. The pair married, and had two children.
As soon as the elder son got to know that his mother was a
wolf, he said to her: &lsquo;Mamma! mamma! I have heard
that you are a wolf.&rsquo; His mother replied: &lsquo;What nonsense
you are talking! How can you say that I am a wolf?&rsquo;
The father of the two children went one day into the field
to plough, and his son said: &lsquo;Papa, let me, too, go with
you.&rsquo; His father said: &lsquo;Come.&rsquo; When they had come to
the field, the son asked his father: &lsquo;Papa, is it true that our
mother is a wolf?&rsquo; His father said: &lsquo;It is.&rsquo; The son inquired:
&lsquo;And where is her skin?&rsquo; His father said: &lsquo;There
it is, on the mill-wheel.&rsquo; No sooner had the son got home,
than he said at once to his mother: &lsquo;Mamma! mamma! you
are a wolf! I know where your skin is.&rsquo; His mother
asked him: &lsquo;Where is my skin?&rsquo; He said: &lsquo;There, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>291]</a></span>
the mill-wheel.&rsquo; His mother said to him: &lsquo;Thank you,
sonny, for rescuing me.&rsquo; Then she went away, and was
never heard of more.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap56" id="chap56"></a>LVI.&mdash;MILUTIN.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A certain</span> man had two children&mdash;one a boy, and the other
a girl. This man required his children to relate to him
every morning what they had dreamed. Indeed, the girl
related her dream, whatever she had dreamed, every morning,
but the boy did not, for he dreamed every night what
eventually happened to him; he dreamed that he killed a
king, took to wife a count&rsquo;s daughter, and became king in
the kingdom in which he killed the king. Exasperated at
this, his father thought the reason why he did not tell his
dream was because he was afraid, and drove him out along
a road, and beat him so that he cried piteously. A count
was driving past, and heard the child crying. He ordered
his servant to go to the man, and tell him not to beat the
child, but say how much he should give him to take it away
himself. The man said, in reply, that he need only take it
away from before his eyes. He immediately took it, and
delivered it to the count, and the count took it away home.
The count had one daughter, who took a great affection
for the boy. It was also a custom with the count that the
children were obliged to relate what they dreamed. But he
would not reveal his dream to the count, and say what he had
dreamed; and he had dreamed the very same dream that
he had dreamed at his father&rsquo;s. Then the count became
very angry, and caused a vault to be built in his garden,
inside which he was to be thrown, and it was to be constructed
of such masonry that nobody should be able to give
him anything to eat, and that no light should by possibility
enter it. But the count&rsquo;s daughter, who was very sorry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>292]</a></span>
for the boy, went out to the masons, and promised them a
purse of money, only to construct it in such a manner that
she would be able to give him food at night. This the
masons did, in return for the good money. He was seven
years inside, and unable to sit or lie.</p>

<p>Now came a time when king sent a staff to the count,
and said he would attack him with an army, if he did
not tell him on which side the staff opened. Now the
damsel came at night, and brought the lad food, saying:
&lsquo;Now, I have brought you food for the last time, because a
king has sent us a staff, and my father must open it; if he
does not open it, he will attack us with an army. We must
perish under the open sky, but you in this vault.&rsquo; He
replied that she was not to frighten herself, &lsquo;but go, lie down,
and soon jump up and say to your father: &ldquo;My dear papa,
I have dreamt of good luck for us.&rdquo; He will say: &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
Reply to him: &ldquo;I dreamt that I should tell you that, if you
will open the staff, you need only fill a tub with water, and
put the staff in it; the staff will turn with that side up on
which it opens.&rdquo;&rsquo; Even so it came to pass. Her father did
so, sealed up the staff on that side, and sent it to the king.
The king wrote back to him: &lsquo;You have certainly done it,
but not with your own stupid head. But you have one
hard by your house, of whom you know not; he has done
this for you.&rsquo; Then he wrote a letter again to the count,
and said: &lsquo;I shall send you three horses all alike, and you
must tell me how many years old each is.&rsquo; And all alike
they were. One was one year old, the second two, and the
third three years old. Then the damsel took him food, and
said to him: &lsquo;Now I am bringing you food for the last
time; you will have to die here, and we in the open air, for
the king has sent us three horses exactly alike, and we must
tell him how old each is.&rsquo; He replied that she must go and
lie down, and say that she had dreamt thus: that he must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>293]</a></span>
prepare three heaps of oats of three different years, and let
the horses go to the oats, and they would go of themselves
each to his own heap; the one which was one year old
would go to the one-year-old oats, the second to the second,
and the third to the third heap. She told him this. And
it came to pass just as she told him. Then he wrote in
reply to the king, and the king to him: &lsquo;Certainly, you have
done this, but not with your own stupid head; but you have
another who does it for you, of whom you are not aware.
But I shall send you one thing more. I shall send you, on
a given day, at the hour when you will be at dinner, a war-mace,
weighing three hundredweight; it will strike the
spoon out of your mouth. You must throw it back to me
just as I threw it to you.&rsquo; Indeed, this, too, came to pass.
The mace flew in, knocked his spoon out of his hands, and
flew off with speed into the cellar, inside which it stuck so
fast that a score of soldiers couldn&rsquo;t move, much less throw,
it. Now the count assembled, and invited all people, but
no one was able to do it. She took him food again, and
said to him: &lsquo;You have set us free twice, but certainly the
third time you will not be able to do so, and now you will
die here, and all of us in the open air.&rsquo; He then asked her
what sort of work it was that had to be done. She told
him, and he answered: &lsquo;Go home and lie down, then get
up and say that you have dreamt that no one else but I can
do it, so I tell you; but the count will not believe you, yet
will think, since you have twice dreamed with success, that
possibly now, too, it may be true.&rsquo; And so it came to pass.
The count caused him to be dug out. He saw how weak
he was, and said: &lsquo;I am stronger than he, but I can&rsquo;t throw
it; how, then, can he throw it?&rsquo; He then said: &lsquo;Go to a
certain king; he has nine hundred cows, and has them all
registered when each was calved. Buy for me one cow,
which is neither more nor less than nine years old, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>294]</a></span>
whatever he says you are to pay for it, pay. If you pay one
kreutzer less, I shall be two hundredweight lighter.&rsquo; Well,
he went thither, and inquired whether he had such a cow.
The king answered that he had. Then he asked the price.
The king replied: &lsquo;Nine thousand pieces of silver.&rsquo; He
paid them, drove it home, and had it slaughtered immediately.
The young man then said that he must be three
months by himself in a house, without anybody being
allowed to go in to him. Now he took at once two pounds
of beef, but did not eat the flesh, but only the soup. This
lasted for three months. Well, the cook told the count that
he would not eat the flesh, in order to serve his own interests.
Then the count went himself to him, and asked him
why he would not eat the flesh. He replied that something
must be brought him to eat. Now he took a piece, threw it
upon the wall, and said to the count: &lsquo;You see the flesh
has fallen down, and the soup has stuck to the wall; and so
it is with me: the soup abides with me, and the flesh goes
down from me.&rsquo; Then he went out to look at the mace.
He was already able to move it. Then he went in for three
months to eat. Then he was able, with his left hand, to
throw it two hundred fathoms high into the air. He went
in once more to eat for three months. Now he was exceedingly
strong, and told the count to write freely to the king,
that on such and such a day, at such and such an hour, the
mace would arrive, and knock the spoon out of his mouth
at dinner. In fact, so it was. He threw it a hundred and
twenty-five hours walk into the other kingdom. Now the
king saw that he had done this also. Then he wrote to
him: &lsquo;Certainly you have done all that I told you, but not
with your own stupid head, but he has done it for you, whom
you caused to be walled up in a vault. But you must send
him here to me, that I may see him.&rsquo; But he wanted to
slay him. Now, the count was unwilling to let him go, but,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>295]</a></span>
nevertheless, he was obliged to do so. &lsquo;But do you know
what, count? Cause all your people to be summoned
hither, and we will select as many as ever we can that resemble
me.&rsquo; There were only nine such, and he was
himself the tenth. Now he told him to have exactly similar
uniforms made for them all, so that, at any rate, no one
would know one to be different from another, and to provide
similar horses for all, and then he would go thither.
Even so it came to pass. Then the ten went. But before
they arrived at the town, he said to them: &lsquo;Indeed, you
don&rsquo;t know why we are going thither; we are going to be
put to death; but I tell you not to be in any wise afraid.
This king will give you the word of command when we
enter: &ldquo;Milutin (such was the boy&rsquo;s name), dismount!&rdquo;
Then you must all dismount so that no one is behindhand,
but all alike, and at once. Then he will say: &ldquo;Milutin, go
into the house!&rdquo;&mdash;all go into the house. &ldquo;Milutin, shut the
door!&rdquo;&mdash;all off to shut it. &ldquo;Milutin, take your seat at table!&rdquo;&mdash;all
do it at once. &ldquo;Milutin, go to bed!&rdquo;&mdash;all off to bed at
once.&rsquo; Even so it was. Thus the king could in no wise
recognise him, and did not venture to slaughter them, but
ordered his servant to conceal himself under a bed, and
listen which spoke most wisely, and put a mark upon him.
Now they all lay down, and began to converse as to what
would come out of this. Milutin then said: &lsquo;Doubtless,
till now he has not recognised me, and will ride after me,
and will overtake us; but never mind that, only kneel down
and pray to God. Then notice well: if I first emit fire out
of my mouth, kill yourselves; but if he emits it first, have
no fear whatever; this signifies to you that human flesh will
seethe in human blood.&rsquo; The man under the bed heard
this speech, and cut off a piece from the heel of his boot.
Morning arrived, and Milutin told them that each must look
well at his clothes: maybe there would be some mark on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>296]</a></span>
someone&rsquo;s uniform. But all at once he observed that just
his boot-heel had been cut off, and said: &lsquo;All give me your
boots, that I may cut off each of the heels just as I have
mine cut off.&rsquo; Now the king came to summon them:
&lsquo;Milutin, come to breakfast!&rsquo; and they all went at once.
And the king saw that they all had a similar mark, and,
therefore, did not know which to put to death. Then he
reprimanded the servant. Now said the king: &lsquo;Milutin, go
home!&rsquo; and they all went homeward at once. But erelong
the king recognised Milutin by his horse&mdash;for he had
the horse from the count&mdash;and overtook him. They immediately
knelt down, as he had previously bidden them,
and he began first to fight on horseback, but nothing came
of it. Then they both dismounted from their horses, and
fought thus, each leaping against the other so that the earth
quaked under them. Thus they fought terribly for some
time. But all at once they observed that the king emitted
fire out of his mouth, and then Milutin afterwards. Then
the king spat pure fire out of his mouth at Milutin, and
Milutin also spat fire. The two fought on in this frightful
manner; but suddenly Milutin overcame the king, threw
him down, cut off his head, and carried it home to the
count. Now all was merriment, and Milutin married the
count&rsquo;s daughter, took possession of the realm of the king
whom he had slain, and there was a grand festival. That&rsquo;s
the end.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap57" id="chap57"></a>LVII.&mdash;THE FRIENDSHIP OF A VILA AND OF THE
MONTHS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A wicked</span> woman married a poor man, who had already a
little daughter named Maritza. Afterwards God gave her a
daughter of her own, whom she loved and cherished more
than her own eyes. On her stepdaughter, who was a good
and very handsome child, she could scarcely bear to cast a
look; therefore she drove her about, teased and tormented
her, in order as soon as possible to make an end of her;
she threw her the poorest remnants of food and everything,
just as she would have done to a dog. Indeed, she would
have given her a snake&rsquo;s tail to eat, if she had had one at
hand; and instead of a bed, she sent her to sleep in an old
trough.</p>

<p>When her so-called mother saw that the girl, in spite of
all this, was good and patient, and grew handsomer than
her daughter, she thought and thought how to find a pretext
to get rid of the orphan out of the house, and devised one.</p>

<p>One day she sent her daughter and stepdaughter to wash
wool; to her own daughter she gave white wool, to her
stepdaughter black, and said to her with sharp threats: &lsquo;If
you don&rsquo;t wash the black wool as white as my daughter
will hers, don&rsquo;t come home any more, or else I shall beat you
out of the house.&rsquo; The poor stepdaughter wept piteously,
entreated her, and said that it was impossible for her to do
this. But all in vain. Seeing that there was no mercy for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>299]</a></span>
her, she tied up the wool and went weeping after her half-sister.
When they came to the water, they undid their
bundles, and began to wash, when a beautiful fair damsel
from somewhere joined and saluted them: &lsquo;Good luck,
friends! do you want any help?&rsquo; The stepmother&rsquo;s daughter
said with a scornful laugh: &lsquo;I want no help; my wool will
soon be white; but our stepdaughter&rsquo;s yonder will not be so
in a hurry.&rsquo; Thereupon the strange damsel stepped up to
the sorrowful Maritza, saying: &lsquo;Come! let us see whether
that wool will allow itself to be washed white.&rsquo; Both began
immediately to rinse and wash, and in a jiffy the black wool
became as white as fresh-fallen snow. When they had
finished washing, her fair friend vanished nobody knew
whither. The stepmother, seeing the white wool, was
amazed and angry, because she had no excuse for driving
her stepdaughter away.</p>

<p>Some time after this came sharp cold and snow. The
wicked stepmother was continually thinking how best to
persecute her unfortunate stepdaughter, and now ordered
her: &lsquo;Take a basket and go off to the mountain; there
gather me ripe strawberries for the new year. If you don&rsquo;t
bring me them, it will be better for you to stay on the mountain.&rsquo;
The orphan Maritza wept piteously, entreated her
and said: &lsquo;How shall poor I procure ripe strawberries in
sharp winter cold?&rsquo; But all in vain. She was obliged to
take the basket and go.</p>

<p>As she was going all in tears over the mountain she met
twelve young men, whom she saluted courteously. They
received the salutation in a friendly manner, and asked her:
&lsquo;Whither are you wading, dear girl, in the snow thus in
tears?&rsquo; She told them the whole story prettily. The young
men said to her: &lsquo;We will help you if you will tell us which
month of the whole year is the best?&rsquo; Maritza said in
reply: &lsquo;They are all good, but the month of March is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>300]</a></span>
best, for it brings us most hope.&rsquo; They were pleased with
her answer, and said: &lsquo;Go into the first glen on the sunny
side; there you will get as many strawberries as you wish.&rsquo;
And indeed she brought her stepmother a basketful of
most excellent strawberries for the new year, and told her
that the young men whom she had met on the mountain
had shown them to her.</p>

<p>Some days later, when the weather had become milder,
the mother said to her own daughter: &lsquo;Go now into the
mountain for strawberries; maybe you will find those young
men, and they will give you similar good fortune, for they
have shown themselves so wonderfully kind to our greasy
stepdaughter.&rsquo; The daughter dressed herself grandly, took
the basket, and skipped off merrily on to the mountain.
When she got there, she did actually meet the twelve young
men, to whom she said haughtily: &lsquo;Show me where the
strawberry-plants grow, as you showed our stepdaughter.&rsquo;
The young men said: &lsquo;Good! provided you guess which
month is the best of the whole year.&rsquo; She answered quickly:
&lsquo;They are all bad, and the month of March is the worst.&rsquo;
But at that speech the whole mountain clouded over in a
jiffy, and a storm beat upon her so that she scarcely panted
home alive. The young men were the twelve months.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the goodness and beauty of the ill-used stepdaughter
was noised about in the district, and a young,
rich and honourable lord arranged with her stepmother to
come on such and such a day with his retinue to betroth the
stepdaughter to be his wife. The stepmother, jealous of the
orphan, did not tell her a single word of this, but thought to
thrust her own daughter surreptitiously into this good fortune.</p>

<p>When the appointed evening came the infamous stepmother
packed her stepdaughter off in good time to the
trough to sleep, then cleared up the house, prepared supper,
dressed out her daughter to the best of her ability, and placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>301]</a></span>
her at table with some knitting in her hands. Thereupon
up came the betrothal party; the stepmother welcomed
them, conducted them into the house, and said to them:
&lsquo;There is my dear stepdaughter.&rsquo; But what good was it?
For in the house they had a cock, who began with all his
might, and without intermission, to crow: &lsquo;Kukuriku,
pretty Maritza in trough! kukuriku, pretty Maritza in
trough!&rsquo; and so forth. When the betrothal party understood
and comprehended the cock&rsquo;s crowing, they insisted
that the real stepdaughter must come out of the trough, and
when they saw her, they could not sufficiently express their
admiration at her beauty and grace, and took her away with
them that very evening, and the wicked stepmother and her
daughter remained put to shame before all people. Maritza
was happy with her husband and with all her house to a
great age and an easy death, for a Vila and all the months
were her friends.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap58" id="chap58"></a>LVIII.&mdash;THE FISHERMAN&rsquo;S SON.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there was a lord on the Danube who had
a fisherman to catch fish for him. This lord was preparing
a great banquet, and ordered his fisherman to catch three
hundredweight of fish in three days. On the first day the
fisherman went early in the morning to catch the fish. But
he could not obtain any. The second day he went again
very early in the morning. He made the round of the
water, but again took none. The third day came. The
fisherman went to catch fish, and went on till mid-day, but
could not net any. In the afternoon he determined to go
home by the waterside, and carried himself as if he were
very much out of sorts. Suddenly up sailed a striped
boat. In the boat sat a gentleman clad in green. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>302]</a></span>
questioned the fisherman saying: &lsquo;Man, why are you so
sorrowful here by the water?&rsquo; The fisherman said: &lsquo;How
should I not be sorrowful? My lord ordered me to catch
three hundredweight of fish in three days; to-day is the last
day, and I have not obtained any.&rsquo; Then said the gentleman:
&lsquo;Promise me that which you don&rsquo;t know that you
have, and you shall to-day catch plenty.&rsquo; The fisherman
thought to himself: &lsquo;What I don&rsquo;t know that I have, I shall
easily do without, if I do promise him.&rsquo; And the gentleman
at the same time added: &lsquo;And I will wait twenty years.
In twenty years you will be able to fulfil your promise.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Agreed,&rsquo; said the fisherman. He cast his nets and drew
them out full of fish. He cast them a second time, and it
was just the same. He cast them once more. The gentleman
said to him: &lsquo;Only send home for them to come with a
waggon and four horses.&rsquo; They came with four horses.
They packed the fish in, so that they scarcely drew them
with the four horses. But before they went home the gentleman
asked the fisherman: &lsquo;But do you know what you have
promised me?&rsquo; The fisherman said: &lsquo;My lord, I do not.
What I don&rsquo;t know that I have, I have promised you, be it
what it may.&rsquo; The gentleman smiled, and said: &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t
know that your wife will be the mother of a son, and this
son you have promised to me. When twenty years have
elapsed, you must just bring him here.&rsquo; Then the fisherman
took the fish home. On the one hand he was glad, on the
other very downcast. When he brought them home his
lord began to grumble, saying: &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a thorough fool!
Why did a messenger come to me to say that you could
not obtain any? Now you have brought me such a quantity
that I hardly know where to stow them.&rsquo; The fisherman
excused himself, and related to his lord the whole series of
occurrences from beginning to end. Afterwards he put a
question to his lord: &lsquo;God only knows how it will be now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>303]</a></span>
since I have done such an evil thing, that I have promised
him my son.&rsquo; His lord said: &lsquo;What of that? Twenty
years is a long time. By then all may be changed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It came to pass. The fisherman&rsquo;s wife became the mother
of a boy. He grew up right handsome. When he became
a little older they sent him to school. At school he learnt
so well, that at sixteen he had learnt enough to be ordained
a priest. But his father and mother said: &lsquo;Not a priest,
for he is promised. Let us rather place him for four years
more in the black school.&rsquo; When he had completed the
course of the black school, he came back to the Danube,
with all before him in the future, as if he were about to
succeed, and behind in the past, because he had already
been successful. Then said he to his father: &lsquo;Father, now
it is time for us to go.&rsquo; The father: &lsquo;To go? whither?&rsquo;
The son: &lsquo;Whither you promised me.&rsquo; The father:
&lsquo;Who promised you any whither?&rsquo; The son: &lsquo;What?
don&rsquo;t you know to whom you promised me twenty years
ago? Let us go to that piece of water, where you then
went to catch fish.&rsquo; The father became very sorrowful.
The son then said: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid. Only quickly coat
over arm and follow me. Only you must do what I instruct
you to do. If you obey me, no harm will happen to you
and me.&rsquo; On the way he also instructed his father as
follows: &lsquo;When we come to that piece of water, the striped
boat will sail up just as when you caught the fish. In it will
sit the gentleman in green to whom you promised me. The
gentleman will push the boat to the shore in shallow water.
I shall step on it with one foot, and stand on dry land with
the other. Then say: &ldquo;My son, I commend you to God
the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost. May these
three always be with you!&rdquo; When you have uttered these
holy words I shall spring into the boat.&rsquo; Everything happened
exactly as the son told his father and instructed him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>304]</a></span>
on the way. The striped boat sailed up on the water. In
it was the gentleman dressed in green. The son stepped
with one foot on the boat, and stood with the other on dry
land. His father commended him to God the Father, and
the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The son sprang on board
the boat, and the gentleman pushed it from the shore. All
at once all sank, the boat, the gentleman, and the son.
The father was terribly frightened, and cried out at the top
of his voice: &lsquo;Jesus, Maria! my son has gone down to
hell!&rsquo; He then crept home very sorrowful.</p>

<p>His son passed through the water into a town which is
called Perdonkorten.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> In this town all the population was
enchanted. He walked and walked about the town, but nowhere
was there anybody. Hunger took possession of him, but
he could get nothing to eat. He bethought himself of going to
catch some fish. He went to the water, caught some, lit a
fire, cooked them, and ate his fill. He then went into the
shade, laid himself down, and fell asleep. He dreamt that
he was told to go to pass the night in a lordly castle, to seat
himself at table, to light a taper on each side of him, and
wait. He did according as he had dreamt. The clock struck
midnight, when suddenly the door opened outside of itself.
A huge snake glided into the house. It came up opposite
the young man, and besought him: &lsquo;Kiss me.&rsquo; He cursed
it, and said: &lsquo;Take thyself off from me, Satan! Thou hast
no power over me.&rsquo; The snake retired through the door.
Thereupon day broke. The young man walked and walked
again about the town. He saw here and there carriages
ready harnessed, but no human being. In the afternoon he
went again to the water to catch fish. When he had eaten
his fill, he went into the shade. He lay down, and soon fell
asleep. Erelong he dreamt what would have happened,
if he had kissed the snake. He woke up, and thought:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>305]</a></span>
&lsquo;This evening I will go back, and will kiss it if it comes.&rsquo;
In fact, he went again into the same house, seated himself
at table, lit two tapers, and waited. The clock struck
twelve. The door opened. Through it glided a very much
larger snake, with two heads. It came up the room opposite
him, and besought him again: &lsquo;Kiss me!&rsquo; Terror seized
him, for it was much more horrible than the one he had
seen the preceding night. Therefore he cursed it again:
&lsquo;Take thyself off from me, Satan! Thou hast no power
over me.&rsquo; The snake again quitted the house. Afterwards
day broke. He went again into the town, caught fish, and
ate his fill. When he had eaten, he went into the shade,
lay down, and fell asleep. Ere long he dreamt again:
&lsquo;Thou wouldst, nevertheless, have only done rightly if thou
hadst kissed the snake.&rsquo; He woke up, and said: &lsquo;This
evening I will kiss it, even if it appears still more terrible.&rsquo;
In the evening he went into the same house. He seated
himself at table, lit two tapers, and waited. When the
tower clock struck twelve, the door opened. A terrible
snake glided in. It had three heads, and was still larger
than the one he saw the preceding evening. It came puffing
opposite him. It began to twine round him, and beseech
him: &lsquo;Kiss me!&rsquo; He pressed his lips to it, and kissed it.</p>

</div>

<p>As soon as he had kissed it, the snake turned into a
beautiful maiden, as beautiful as a damsel could be. The
snake was the enchanted daughter of the lord of the castle.
After the kiss, all belonging to the castle, and the whole
town, were disenchanted. Erelong the father and mother
of the disenchanted daughter came into the room. They
welcomed him with the greatest joy. The father said to
him: &lsquo;Friend, I give you my kingdom and my daughter, if
she pleases you.&rsquo; He replied: &lsquo;Let us wait a bit, that we
may make a little acquaintance with each other.&rsquo; Thereupon
they prepared a grand supper. They supped, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>306]</a></span>
did not go to bed till late. In the morning they got up.
The young man and the damsel went a walk in the town.
The whole town rejoiced over him, and pointed at him,
saying: &lsquo;That is our deliverer.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now the young man was content with all. Only he still
felt sorry, when he bethought himself: &lsquo;Here am I in such
good fortune, while my father on the Danube is thinking
that I have fallen into the abyss of hell. If I could only
just go to my father on the Danube, to tell him of my luck,
I should then be completely content.&rsquo; Thereupon the
damsel said to him: &lsquo;I have something such that you could
easily go to your father, if you would but be sure to come
back.&rsquo; He said: &lsquo;You know that I shall come. Nowhere
have I had such good fortune as here.&rsquo; Now they agreed
that she would wait for him seven years, if he did not return
before. The damsel gave him a certain ring, and said:
&lsquo;Here is this ring, look through it, and think to yourself
that you would like to be with your father by the Danube,
and you will find yourself there. When you wish to come
back to me, look again through the ring, and think to yourself
that you would like to be with me, and you will find
yourself here with me. But you must not show it to anybody,
lest you lose it. If you lose it, it will be very difficult
for you ever to come to us.&rsquo; The young man looked through
the ring, thought to himself that he would like to be with his
father by the Danube, and in a moment there he was.
His father and mother were very, very glad to see him safe
and sound once more. They asked him all manner of
questions. He related to them how he had darted through
the water into an enchanted city, and what had been his
hap afterwards. The whole household jumped for joy at
hearing how fortunate he had been. Especially rejoiced
was his mother, who walked continually on tiptoe for joy.
Afterwards his father took him to his lord, for whom he still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>307]</a></span>
caught fish. There, again, the whole household rejoiced
greatly over him. The lord had two daughters. Erelong he
said to him: &lsquo;Stay with us. I will give you a portion of my
kingdom and one daughter, if it pleases you.&rsquo; He thought
to himself: &lsquo;There there awaits me a whole kingdom, and a
larger one than this. The lady, too, there, is handsomer than
this one.&rsquo; Nevertheless he said within himself: &lsquo;Suppose
I stay here a day or two. I shall easily go back before the
time is out. Seven years don&rsquo;t pass so quickly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It came to pass that he went a walk one day with the
two daughters. On the road the silly fellow showed
them the ring, and told them how he had come back
into that country. They thought to themselves: &lsquo;Behold!
if we could but take that ring from him, then he would
be glad to stay with us.&rsquo; They went a little farther on,
and one of them said: &lsquo;Let us sit down a bit here in
the shade.&rsquo; They sat down on the grass under a tree.
They had not sat there long when one of them said to him:
&lsquo;Listen! listen! What have you got in your hair?&rsquo; He:
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;ve anything.&rsquo; She: &lsquo;You have something;
you have indeed. Let me look at your head.&rsquo; Now
she began to examine and stroke his head till he fell fast
asleep. The other, on seeing this, put her hand quickly
into his pocket, and took out his ring. They rose up, and
prolonged their walk. They walked and walked about the
country, when he put his hand into his pocket, and found
that the ring was no longer there. He said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve lost my
ring. What shall I do now?&rsquo; They said: &lsquo;Let us go
back. We will look for it. Maybe we shall find it.&rsquo; They
went back to the self-same place where they had been sitting.
They helped him to look for it carefully. They looked for
it in vain, for one of them had got it in her own pocket.</p>

<p>After this, he remained five years more in that house.
When the fifth year had elapsed, he said: &lsquo;This won&rsquo;t do.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>308]</a></span>
If I remain here, I shall never get to Perdonkorten. Now
go I must. There will be two years for me, eventually, to
get there.&rsquo; Once upon a time he was benighted. He went
through thickets, where there was no living soul. He espied
a light on another hill. He said: &lsquo;Thither I must go.
There will be people there.&rsquo; He went thither. There was
nobody at home but a woman. He asked whether they
would take him in for the night. The woman said to him:
&lsquo;I would willingly take you in for the night, but I do not
advise you to stay here. My three brothers are three
thieves. When night is over, they will come home, and
will soon put you to death.&rsquo; He said: &lsquo;Never fear! Only
bring me a pint of wine, that I may drink and wait for
them here at the table.&rsquo; When night was over, up came
the three brothers home. He sat in the house at the table,
and busied himself with the wine. They asked him: &lsquo;Who
are you?&rsquo; He replied: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know who I am. I&rsquo;m a
poor fellow who roams hither and thither in the world,
wheresoever I must.&rsquo; They said: &lsquo;But to what family do
you belong?&rsquo; He said: &lsquo;That also I don&rsquo;t know. All
through I am knocking about in the world. Nowhere am I at
home.&rsquo; They said: &lsquo;What is your name? How do you
write yourself?&rsquo; He had gone through the course of study
at the black school; therefore he knew how they wrote their
names, and that they had lost a brother. He therefore told
them their surname, and the name of their lost brother.
They said: &lsquo;You are indeed our own brother, whom we
lost many years ago.&rsquo; He said: &lsquo;It is easy to see that I
am.&rsquo; They asked him: &lsquo;But are you willing to take up our
business?&rsquo; He said: &lsquo;Why not, if your business is honest,
and one can easily get one&rsquo;s living from it?&rsquo; They said:
&lsquo;From our handicraft a living is got right easily. At home
we do nothing at all, and have always plenty to eat and
plenty to drink.&rsquo; He inquired: &lsquo;What have you gained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>309]</a></span>
to-day?&rsquo; They replied: &lsquo;To-day we have gained more than
we ever gained before. We have obtained shoes: whoever
puts them on will fly two hundred miles in half an hour.
We have obtained a mantle: whoever wraps himself in it,
nobody sees him. We have obtained a hat: whoever puts
it on his head, and throws it before him, hills open themselves
to him, so that he follows it whithersoever he will.&rsquo;
He: &lsquo;But is this true?&rsquo; They: &lsquo;It is.&rsquo; He: &lsquo;Now, then,
let&rsquo;s try this dress on me. We&rsquo;ll see how it will fit me.&rsquo; He
put on the shoes, wrapped himself in the mantle, clapped
the hat on his head, and stepped a little way from them. He
asked them: &lsquo;But don&rsquo;t you really see me?&rsquo; They said:
&lsquo;Nobody sees you.&rsquo; Then he gave a jump, so that the earth
quaked. They hurried after him, as it were, in the dark;
but he escaped them, for nobody saw him.</p>

<p>He then flew to the place where the sun rises. He
thought to himself: &lsquo;The sun gives light in all regions; he
will therefore know the way to Perdonkorten.&rsquo; When he
came to the sun&rsquo;s house, he asked the servant: &lsquo;Is my lord
the sun at home?&rsquo; The servant: &lsquo;He is not; he is gone
to give light on the earth. He will come home in the
evening. You must wait for him if you want to speak with
him. Only I tell you that when he comes home, there will
be such a heat, that you will curl up like a rasher of bacon,
if you don&rsquo;t hide yourself.&rsquo; The traveller: &lsquo;If it is so, I
will bury myself in the ground. When the sun comes home,
come and call me.&rsquo; He went, and did bury himself deep
in the ground. When the sun came home and flew down,
the servant came to call him. &lsquo;Now, then, my lord the sun
is at home.&rsquo; He got up and went to the sun. When
he came into the house the sun asked him: &lsquo;What have
you got to say?&rsquo; He said: &lsquo;I have come to ask you
the road to the city of Perdonkorten. You enlighten all
lands; surely you know the way thither.&rsquo; The sun: &lsquo;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>310]</a></span>
don&rsquo;t know the way thither. It must be somewhere among
hills and narrow dales, where I never go. The moon
gives light more in hollow places; you must go where she
rises.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He went. He leaped, and was at once at the place
where the moon rises. Neither was she at home. He
asked her lady&rsquo;s maid: &lsquo;Whither has my lady moon gone
that she is not at home?&rsquo; The maid: &lsquo;She is gone to give
light on the earth.&rsquo; He: &lsquo;I will wait, then.&rsquo; The maid:
&lsquo;It is dangerous to wait. When she flies faintly shining
home, such a frost will be caused that you will stiffen like
an icicle.&rsquo; He: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll bury myself therefore in the ashes.
When she returns home, come and call me.&rsquo; Towards
morning the moon came freezing home. He shivered in
the ashes, but didn&rsquo;t stiffen. When the moon had put herself
to rights, her maid went to call him, and said: &lsquo;Now
come; the moon is at home.&rsquo; He rose out of the ashes,
shivered a little, and went to the moon. When he entered
the house, the moon asked him: &lsquo;What do you want? What
have you got to say?&rsquo; He said: &lsquo;Nothing wrong, my lady
moon&mdash;nothing wrong. I have come to ask you the road
to the city of Perdonkorten. You throw light into all dark
holes; therefore, you surely know which way to go thither.&rsquo;
The moon: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know that. It must be among such
hills that I never get there. If you wish to learn it, you
must go where the wind rises. He flies over all abysses,
therefore he will surely be able to indicate you the way
thither.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In a jiffy he was there. The wind was just then at home.
He asked him: &lsquo;My lord the wind, do you know the way
to the city of Perdonkorten?&rsquo; The wind: &lsquo;Of course I
do. Anyhow, I&rsquo;m going thither to-morrow morning at
three. The king&rsquo;s daughter there is betrothed, and I am
going to blow for them at the wedding, that it may not be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>311]</a></span>
too warm. But I shall go through such abysses and such
rocks, that I don&rsquo;t know whether you will be able to follow
me.&rsquo; The traveller: &lsquo;My lord the wind, never fear. No
rock will stop me. I have such a hat, that if I throw it, the
ground opens and I go after it whithersoever I will.&rsquo; The
wind: &lsquo;Well, then, let us go.&rsquo; They went at three. They
came to a terrible rock. The wind roared, and made his
way by a hole through the terrible rock. He could not
follow him. Therefore he took off his hat and threw it
against the rock. The rock opened. The wind glided on
in front and he followed quickly behind.</p>

<p>When it was half-past four in the morning, they had made
their way to the city of Perdonkorten. The wind went to
blow at the wedding that it mightn&rsquo;t be too warm for them.
<em>He</em> went into the church, seated himself on a bench, and
waited for the wedding-party. At eleven music was heard,
and fifty couples of wedding guests came into the church.
One was more handsomely dressed than the rest. His
reverence the chaplain proceeded to say mass for them.
After mass he began to take the marriage service. <em>He</em> was
sitting on a bench, but nobody saw him, because he had
that mantle on. Suddenly he rose from the bench, and
gave a thump on the chaplain&rsquo;s books, so that they fell with
a bang on the floor. The chaplain said: &lsquo;One of you two
must have such a sin upon him, that you are unfit to receive
this sacrament.&rsquo; Now the bride began to relate how someone
had once come to deliver them. With this person a
mutual engagement had been made that she would wait for
him seven years, etc. The chaplain: &lsquo;How much time has
elapsed?&rsquo; She: &lsquo;Five years and a half.&rsquo; The chaplain:
&lsquo;Now you two must wait a year and a half more. If in that
time nothing is heard of him, then you may marry.&rsquo; The
chaplain, moreover, asked her: &lsquo;Which would you rather
have, this one or that other?&rsquo; The lady: &lsquo;I should prefer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>312]</a></span>
the other, should he come. But I know that I shall never
see him again.&rsquo;</p>

<p><em>He</em> heard these words, and they pleased him. Now they
went home from the church. He who had thumped the
books walked amidst the wedding-party, but nobody saw
him, because he had the mantle on. The damsel&rsquo;s father
thought it hard thus to send the wedding guests away home,
therefore he gave them several cups of wine. The guests
drank the wine, and <em>he</em> went up and down in the house, but
nobody saw him. When all the wedding guests had taken
themselves off home, he doffed his mantle, hung it on a peg,
and they recognised him as their deliverer. The beautiful
damsel met him in the middle of the house. She threw her
arms round his neck, and said: &lsquo;Behold! to-day I should
have been married to another husband, if God had not protected
me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Hereupon they soon prepared a marriage with this new
bridegroom. They went to the wedding. The wedding
passed off successfully. They got ready a right handsome
wedding-feast for them. They had plenty of everything&mdash;plenty
to drink, and plenty to eat. Moreover, they gave me
wine to drink out of a sieve, and bread to eat out of a glass,
and one on the back with a shovel. After that I took
myself off.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap59" id="chap59"></a>LIX.&mdash;THE WHITE SNAKE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time snakes multiplied so prodigiously in
the district of Osojani (Ossiach), that every place swarmed
with them. The peasants in that district were in evil case.
The snakes crept into the parlours, the churches, the dairies,
and the beds. People had not even quiet at table, for the
hungry snakes made their way into the dish. But the
greatest terror was caused by a frightfully large white snake,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>313]</a></span>
which was several times seen attacking the cattle at Ososcica
(G&ouml;rlitz Alpe). The peasants did not know how to help
themselves; they instituted processions, and went on pilgrimages,
that God might please to remove that terrible
scourge from them. But neither did that help them.</p>

<p>When the poor people were in the greatest distress, and
knew not how to act to rid themselves of this plague, one
day an unknown man came into the district, who promised
to put an end to every one of the snakes, provided they
could assure him that they had seen no great white snake.
&lsquo;We have not seen one at all,&rsquo; was the reply of some of the
number that had collected round the stranger.</p>

<p>Then he caused a great pile to be constructed round
a tall fir, and when he had climbed to the top of the fir, he
ordered them to set the whole pile on fire on all sides, and
afterwards to run quickly aside.</p>

<p>When the flame had risen on all sides against the tall fir,
the unknown man took a bone pipe out of his pocket, and
began to blow it so powerfully that everybody&rsquo;s ears tingled.
Quickly up rushed and crowded from all quarters a vast
number of snakes, lizards, and salamanders to the pile, and,
driven by some strange force, all sprang into the fire and
perished there. But all at once a mightier and shriller hiss
was heard from Ososcica, so that all present were seized
with fear and dread. The man on the fir, at hearing it,
trembled with terror: &lsquo;Woe is me! there is no help for
me!&rsquo; so said he. &lsquo;I have heard a white snake hiss; why
did you thus mislead me? But be so compassionate as not
to forget every year to give alms to the poor on my behalf.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Scarcely had the poor man uttered these words, when a
terrible snake wound its way up with a great noise, like a
furious torrent, over the sharp rocks, and plunged into the
lake, so that the foam flew up. It soon swam to the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>314]</a></span>
side of the lake, and, all exasperated, rushed to the burning
pile, reared itself up against the fir, and pushed the poor
man into the fire. The snake itself struggled and hissed
terribly in the fire, but the strong fire soon overpowered it.</p>

<p>Thus perished, along with the whole lizard race, the monstrous
snake which had done so much harm to the cattle.
The peasants were again able without fear to carry on their
occupations, and the shepherds at Ososcica to pasture their
cattle without anxiety. The grateful people have not up to
the present time forgotten the promise of their ancestors,
and every year on that self-same day distribute gifts of corn
to the poor.</p>



<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3 class="nobreak"><a name="chap60" id="chap60"></a>LX.&mdash;THE VILA.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> warm summer day a tall and handsome young man of
Veprim was going over the hill Uczka, and found by the
path on the grass a beautiful maiden, dressed in white, with
a sun-kerchief, and was astounded on beholding the beauty
of her countenance. Not wishing to awaken her, he tore
off a large branch, and fixed it quietly in the ground, to
form a shade for her. Erelong she woke up, saw the branch
which had been planted, herself in the shade, and the young
man standing by her. She asked him: &lsquo;Are you, young
man, the person who set up this shade for me?&rsquo; He
replied: &lsquo;I am; for your appearance pleased me, and I
was afraid that the sun would scorch you.&rsquo; She said to him
further: &lsquo;What do you want for this kindness?&rsquo; The
young man replied merrily: &lsquo;Allow me to behold your most
beautiful countenance, and to take you to wife.&rsquo; &lsquo;Good!
I am content to take you for my husband,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;but
you must know that I am a Vila. But you must never
utter my name; if you speak my name Vila, I must quit
you at once.&rsquo; He promised that he would not, conducted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>315]</a></span>
her home, told his parents all that had happened, and how
it had happened, only did not tell them that his bride was a
Vila. She pleased them, and they willingly consented to
the match. Erelong they were wedded. The two lived for
some years in cheerful happiness; domestic prosperity continued
in every shape and form, and she bore him a little
daughter, beautiful as an angel.</p>

<p>Some years afterwards the young man one summer morning
heard it thundering quite early. He got up, went to
the window, saw that a terrible storm was brewing, and said
to his wife: &lsquo;Wife, it is a pity and a great misfortune that
we haven&rsquo;t cut our wheat; the hail will beat it all down.&rsquo;
She said to him: &lsquo;Never fear; it won&rsquo;t beat ours down.&rsquo;
After saying this she rose and went in front of the door.
When she came back a terrible hailstorm began to fall. Her
husband said reproachfully: &lsquo;I told you we should lose all
our wheat.&rsquo; She laughed at him, and said in reply: &lsquo;Go to
the threshing-floor; you&rsquo;ll see that it hasn&rsquo;t beaten it down
for <em>us</em>.&rsquo; When the hail ceased, the husband did go to the
threshing-floor, and there saw all the wheat nicely put together
in sheaves, and, on returning, called out in utter
astonishment: &lsquo;Ah, she is a Vila! she is a Vila!&rsquo; But that
moment she vanished. Her husband remained sad and
sorrowful with his little daughter without his Vila wife.</p>

<p>The Vila mother still came back from time to time, visible
only to her little daughter, helping her in all needs, as the
most careful mother, until she grew up to a marriageable
age. When the Vila&rsquo;s daughter came to the proper time
of life, she married and was the ancestress of the present
family of Polharski.&mdash;So the story.</p>
